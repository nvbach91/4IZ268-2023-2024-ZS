                    <h2>Alexey Pajitnov</h2>
                    <p>
                        Alexey Pajitnov was born on 16th of April 1955. He spent his early years with his mother going
                        to film screenings, solving puzzles, and studying mathematics in the Soviet Union. He started
                        his career as an intern at the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1977. After graduating in 1979, he
                        started working there and in his free time he used its facilities for creating video games
                        including recreating his favourite childhood game pentaminoes. That is when Tetris was created
                        in 1985. It immediately brought attention and was shared around the Academy, other research
                        centres around the Soviet Union and in 1986 even in the West.

                        He moved to the United States in 1991 and gained citizenship there. He continued developing
                        games because it was his passion - in fact, he did not earn one single penny from Tetris until
                        1996 when he and his friend Henk Rogers founded the Tetris Company and reverted rights for
                        Tetris to Pajitnov. From that moment Pajitnov has been earning royalty for each Tetris game sold
                        worldwide.
