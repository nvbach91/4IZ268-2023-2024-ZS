                    <h2>Best players</h2>
                    <p>There are many ways to determine the best players - number of CTWC (classic Tetris world
                        championship) titles, win percentage, high score etc. Therefore, the list below is just my
                        personal selection of four players whom I consider as absolute legends for different reasons.
                    </p>

                        <h3>Jonas Neubauer</h3>
                        <img class="player-img" src="../img/jonas.jpg" alt="Jonas Neubauer">
                        <p>Jonas was born in 1981 and unfortunately died in 2021. He is considered to be one of the best
                            Tetris players in the history - he won 7 CTWC championship and he is known as the first
                            player to achieve maxout - score over 999 999. He took huge part in promoting classic NES
                            Tetris and it is fair to say that Tetris is popular (even though it is almost 40 years old)
                            thanks to him and a few other friends.</p>
                        <p>Due to the fact that the only technique he used was DAS (in his years of playing other
                            techniques weren't a thing yet) and the competition became much harder he won his last title
                            in 2017 and in 2018 CTWC new era came with Joseph Saelee beating him in the final.</p>

                        <h3>Joseph Saelee</h3>
                        <img class="player-img" src="../img/joseph.jpg" alt="Joseph Saelee">
                        <p>Joseph also known as JdMfX_ was born in 2002. He is known as the guy who beat Jonas in the
                            final of 2018 CTWC. He could do that mainly because he was one of the first players to
                            master hypertapping technique and with that he could play after 29 level speed which was
                            considered in previous years as kill screen - unplayable. He won two titles and achieved
                            over 50 NES records in his short career which he ended after loss in final in 2021.</p>

                        <h3>Michael Artiaga</h3>
                        <img class="player-img" src="../img/dog.jpg" alt="Michael Artiaga">
                        <p>Michael also known as dogplayingtetris was born in 2007. The most notable moment in his
                            career is from 2020 when he won his first CTWC while being just 13 years old - this fact is
                            much more amazing because his opponent was his brother Andy (15 years old at that time).
                            Michael has won it again one year later. He is part of the “Big 6” as well as EricICX - 6
                            players who absolutely dominated throughout 2022 and 2023. He used hypertapping in the
                            beginning of his career however he learned rolling later on to be able to stand with
                            competition.</p>

                        <h3>Eric Tolt</h3>
                        <img class="player-img" src="../img/eric.jpg" alt="Eric Tolt">
                        <p>Eric alias EricICX was born in 2004. He is CTWC Championship title holder from 2022. He
                            unfortunately choked the last one held in 2023 but that does not change the fact that he has
                            currently the highest score of all time in NES Tetris. His other big achievement is being
                            the first player in history to play on glitched colours by completing 1320 lines in one
                            single game. He uses rolling otherwise he would not be able to complete all above. </p>
