                    <h2>How to play</h2>
                    <p>The beauty of the game is how simple you can play it. Just place different pieces on the board as
                        they fall and try to fill the entire row without any blank spaces. If you manage to do so, the
                        row will disappear, and you will gain points depending how many lines/rows you cleared at once.
                        The most points can be scored by placing the long bar in the way that you clear all four lines
                        which is maximum and you are rewarded with maximum points - that is called Tetris.</p>
                    <p>Even though how simple the gameplay is, there are many strategies and techniques of playing.
                        Let's take a look on a few basic tips that can improve your high score. Below, there are three
                        main playing techniques you can practice. Note: all of the information is dedicated to the
                        classic version - NES Tetris. However, most of the tips can be used in other versions as well.

                        <li>Start with slower speed and try to be as consistent as you can.</li>
                        <li>Keep your stack flat and build your extra pieces on the left because of rotation of the
                            pieces.</li>
                        <li>Learn all rotations of pieces.</li>
                        <li>Go to higher speeds when you learned all above.</li>
                        <li>Score as many tetrises as you can.</li>
                        <li>Practice better technique.</li>

                        <h3>DAS</h3>
                        <p>There are three main techniques how to play on your NES controller. First one is called DAS -
                            delayed auto shift. It is important to perfect your timing when new pieces fall down. This
                            method is the easiest but it is not sustainable for higher speeds (level 19+).</p>

                        <h3>Hypertapping</h3>
                        <p>Second technique is called hypertapping and was invented few years ago by new young players.
                            The name explains itself. You need to press the controller very fast to be able to move
                            pieces around. With mastering this you can achieve higher level speeds such as speed after
                            level 29. </p>

                        <h3>Rolling</h3>
                        <p>However, almost 40 years after the game was created, new technique came - rolling. You roll
                            all your fingers from the bottom of the controller to achieve more presses of the button
                            than hypertappers. This method became crucial for players to learn to be able to compete
                            with the best. However, it is by far the hardest to master. Visit next page to see the <a
