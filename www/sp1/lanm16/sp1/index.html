                    <p>
                        Tetris is a video game from the Soviet Union created by <a href="./author"><strong>Alexey
                                Pajitnov</strong></a> in 1985. The name for the game comes from the terms tetrominoes -
                        different
                        shaped pieces of size four and his favourite game tennis. It is said to be the greatest game
                        ever with sales exceeding 510 million copies of different versions of the game (according to the
                        official Tetris website). The goal of the game is known to everybody - clear lines as efficient
                        as you can and achieve the highest score possible.

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>As it is said above Tetris was designed by Soviet programmer <a
                                href="./author"><strong>Alexey Pajitnov</strong></a> back in 1985 while he was working
                            in the Computer Centre of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The early version of the game did
                            not have any colour or any pointing system. That is when his new friend came - video game
                            designer from the Netherlands Henk Rogers, who helped him improve the game and make it
                            playable.</p>
                        <p>Henk Rogers originally came to the Soviet Union to buy licence for the game to be able to
                            sell it worldwide. However, as we all know about the Soviet Union they immediately stepped
                            in and said that any transaction will go through them. That was just the start of the war
                            for the license but that is properly described in film Tetris (2023).</p>
                        <p>Finally, Tetris went worldwide under Nintendo and it was successful. Nintendo sold over 1.5
                            million copies of the NES (Nintendo entertainment system) version and over 2 million copies
                            in Gameboy colour.</p>
