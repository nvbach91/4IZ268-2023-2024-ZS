            <h3>How I Started Playing Tennis</h3>
            <p>I first picked up a tennis racket in the July 2022. It was an instant connection, and since then, I've
                been playing (almost) non-stop.
                Tennis helps me fight anxiety and feel stronger, somehow I become very happy after playing tennis for 1
                hour.
            </p>

            <h3>Tournaments and Competitions</h3>
            <p>Throughout my rather short journey, I've participated in various tournaments for begginers. Each one was
                a unique experience, teaching me more about the sport and myself.
                It was challenging, painful, but the outcome was worth it. I still did not get the 1st place, so I'm
                coming for it.</p>

            <h3>My Favorite Tennis Gear</h3>
            <p>Having the right gear is crucial in tennis. I have my preferences, from rackets to shoes, which have been
                on my whishlist for a long time.</p>
            <p>First one is <b>Yonex Vcore Pro 100L racket</b>, which I've tried recently and fell in love. Very light
                and easy to play and has perfect control.</p>
            <p>Second come <b>Wilson Clay Tennis shoes</b>, which I haven't tried, but heard that they are really comfy.
                Who does not like a good pair of shoes?</p>
            <p>Last but not least - <b>Babolat tennis backpack by Rafael Nadal</b>. Perfect for 3 rackets and other
                necessities required for training. Love.</p>
