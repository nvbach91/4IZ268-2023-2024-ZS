            <div class="introduction-section">
                <p>I started crocheting when I was 17. At that time I became sick and could not visit school for 3
                    weeks, so I've found myself in crocheting. Slowly but surely my whole family got their new winter
                    hats, and I've found a way to make my closest family members and friend happy.</p>

                <h3>Winter hats &amp; scarves</h3>
                <p>I really wanted to have my own fluffy winter hat, so it was my first and my most loved project. I
                    started by doing the simplest winter hats possible - soon after that all of my family members had
                    their own hat. It was easy, fun, relaxing, and also very warm for a cold winter. After winter hats I
                    immediately started with scarves - a great (in my opinion) addition to a cool hat.</p>

                <h3>Soon-to-be made projects</h3>
                <p>Nowadays I am dreaming of making small crochet toys, but unfortunately I did not have time to start.
                    I believe that it will also be easy and fun, and I love giving gifts to my friends, so I will have
                    more options to choose.</p>

            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Starting Your Crochet Journey</h3>
                <p>Begin with Simple Projects: Start with easy patterns like scarves or coasters. This builds your
                    confidence and skills gradually.</p>
                <p>Understanding Yarn: Research about different types of yarn and their suitability for various
                    projects. I recommend medium
                    weight yarn for the begginers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Mastering the Basics</h3>
                <p>Be consistent: Maintaining a consistent yarn tension is key to uniform stitches. Practice makes
                    perfect.</p>
                <p>Reading Patterns and Charts: Take time to familiarize yourself with common crochet symbols and
                    abbreviations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Overcoming Common Challenges</h3>
                <p>Twisted Chains: When starting with a chain, ensure it's not twisted before joining it into a round.
                    Using stitch
                    markers can help.</p>
                <p>Uneven Edges: If your edges are uneven, check if you’re missing stitches or adding extra ones.
                    Counting stitches in
                    each row can prevent this.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Additional Tips</h3>
                <p>Keep Your Hands Relaxed: Crocheting for long periods can strain your hands. Take breaks and stretch
                    your fingers.</p>
                <p>Join a Crocheting Group: If your edges are uneven, check if you’re missing stitches or adding extra
                    ones. Counting stitches in
                    each row can prevent this.</p>
