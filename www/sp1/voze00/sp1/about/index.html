                <main>My name is Ekaterina, but my friends call me Káťa.
                    <p>Born in Ufa, Russia, I've moved to Prague when I was 18. Never regretted that. I've loved it here
                        ever since. This city feels like home now, and I've made lots of friends.</p>
                    <p>For a while, I worked with social media and did some influencer marketing. It was fun and I
                        actually really enjoyed that. But now, I'm exploring the world of data analytics. It's
                        interesting, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it takes me. But I really want to finish my
                        bachelor's degree.</p>
                    This website isn't just about my studies, though. It's also about the things I like to do for fun.
                    I'll share some of my favorite hobbies with you, like playing tennis, gaming, cooking, and
                    crocheting.
                    <p>
                        I hope you find something here that interests you. Have a look around and enjoy your stay!
