                <h2>My Trackmania career</h2>
                <p>
                    I started competing back in 2013 in Trackmania United Forever for team Dunno. I soon realized
                    that I loved competing
                    and soon I changed to the main competitive game at the time - Trackmania2 Stadium. My first
                    stadium team was Czech team called Speedo.
                    In the summer 2015 I joined my first professional team - team Acer. Unfortunately the company
                    decided to leave esports in the early 2016.¨
                    After that I played under PlanetKey Dynamics, who I represented at Maniaplanet World Cup 2016 in
                    Paris.
                    I was one of the youngest people to ever been at the world cup. After that I took part in
                    Trackmania ProLeague in 2017.
                    In 2018 I finished 9th at Trackmania World Championships during Paris Games Week.
                    However with the introduction of Trackmania Grand League in 2019 and nonsensical point systems I
                    slowly started losing interest in the game.
                    My last serious tournament was From Zero To Hero in 2020.
