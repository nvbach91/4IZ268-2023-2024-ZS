            <h2>What is Anime?</h2>
            <p>Anime is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in
                English,
                anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a
                term
                derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of
                style
                or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside
                Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that can be considered as "anime".

            <h3>Differences between Various Animes</h3>
            <p>Anime differs from other forms of animation by its art styles, methods of animation, its production, and
                its
                process. Visually, anime works exhibit a wide variety of art styles, differing between creators,
                artists,
                and studios. While no single art style predominates anime as a whole, they do share some similar
                attributes
                in terms of animation technique and character design. Anime is fundamentally characterized by the use of
                limited animation, flat expression, the suspension of time, its thematic range, the presence of
                historical
                figures, its complex narrative line and, above all, a peculiar drawing style, with characters
                characterized
                by large and oval eyes, with very defined lines, bright colors and reduced movement of the lips.

            <h3>Why Anime?</h3>
            <p>Most anime films are characterized by energetic characters and themes like supernatural forces, romance,
                and
                sci-fi. People watch anime for various reasons; humorous, inspirational, or relatable anime movies are
                incredibly popular worldwide. This explains why many artists and production houses have put time and
                effort
                into creating anime movies.
