            <p>The background is an important part of the scene and can help to set the mood and atmosphere. Start by
                sketching out the basic shapes and then adding details such as buildings, trees, and other elements to
                create a fully realized environment.</p>

            </p>

            <h3>1. Types of backgrounds</h3>
            <p>First of all, it's important to note that a background doesn't have to be an incredibly realistic
                detailed painted landscape to be considered 'good' or 'amazing' even. Depending on what you're going
                for, even a monotonous or abstract background can have a great impact! It can be very powerful to
                balance great detail (in your foreground, extra objects, characters, and so on) with simplicity, like in
                the examples below</p>

            <figure class="image-content">

                <figcaption><i>091717 by Oxmiruku</i></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure class="image-content-tall">
                <img src="../images/art/a2.png" alt="A2 by Jayuu">
                <figcaption><i>A2 by Jayuu</i></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Other themes that are often used for more complex backgrounds are nature, landscapes, cityscapes, skies,
                rooms, buildings, and many more. Different types of backgrounds can require different skills, for
                example, cityscapes are often more demanding when it comes to perspective, while nature may require
                better rendering skills. Nonetheless, there are things that are good to know for all types of
                backgrounds, so let's have a look!</p>


            <h3>2. Inspiration and Ideas</h3>
            <p>I often have a general idea of what I want to do with the background if I start on an artwork, but it's
                hard to work from that alone. That's why I like to take inspiration from all kinds of resources;
                pictures I find online or that I have taken myself, work from other artists, and so forth, and have
                folders on my computer where I store images that I find interesting. Sites such as Pinterest can also be
                really helpful for browsing for inspiration and storing images you like! You can mix and combine images
                that fit your ideas or inspire you and make a collage.</p>
            <figure class="image-content">
                <img src="../images/art/concept-ideas.jpg" alt="Concept ideas compared to final background">
                <figcaption>Example of how some of my inspiration images have influenced the final background in <i>In
                        Nomine Iustitia.</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If you're really stuck for inspiration, ask yourself some questions. What suits your subject? Are there
                objects easily associated with your character? Are there symbols that you would like to include? And
                remember, as seen above, a good background doesn't have to be all that complex, either.</p>
            <p>Don't be afraid to use references. This applies to all aspects of your artwork; if they're available, use
                them! It's very hard to make a background look believable just from memory or imagination alone,
                especially when it comes to rendering. A quick Google search will often already find you some good
                reference images if you're stuck.</p>
            <p>Of course, it is important that you are responsible with your use of references and resources. Especially
                when taking inspiration from the works of other artists, be aware of the difference between taking
                inspiration from a certain artwork you like or blatantly copying concepts or backgrounds in obvious
                ways. If you look at the example above, I have taken the idea of a small round gazebo in the background,
                but I did not directly copy the design. When you heavily reference a resource, don't forget to credit
                the original when you submit online.</p>

            <h3>3. Where to Start</h3>
            <p>If you have enough inspiration but are really at a loss when it comes to where to start, it might be
                useful for you to start out with a few thumbnails. Thumbnails are small-scale sketches that can be as
                rough as you like, but are meant to test out a few ideas quickly, from which you can pick the best and
                base the main sketch on that thumbnail.</p>
            <p>If you've picked out a good thumbnail, you can start on laying out the main features of the background.
                Preparing your background is just as important as the main subject of your art, especially with complex
                backgrounds, but you can approach it in different ways. Some like to sketch out and then use clean
                linework for the background, others keep it more loose and sketchy, and I personally like the 'digital
                painting' approach.</p>
            <figure class="image-content">
                <img src="../images/art/initial-layout.jpg" alt="Initial layout of background elements">
                <figcaption>I like to start my backgrounds by roughly laying out objects, shapes, and colors, and for
                    more detailed parts, I'll add a sketch first.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>When you're in this stage, don't attach yourself too much just yet and don't be afraid to play around
                with composition. Your first idea is not always the best, and some small adjustments like enlarging an
                object, moving it to the left or to the right, or even deforming it slightly can all have a big effect.
            </p>

            <h3>4. The Power of Suggestion</h3>
            <p><i>(also known as 'clever laziness')</i></p>
            <p>I would like to address this as a separate point from anything else I am going to say in this article,
                because in my opinion this is one of the most important things to know when it comes to art, especially
                in the case of backgrounds.</p>
            <p>One of the most powerful tools for an artist is being able to speak to the imagination of the viewer.
                Oftentimes, a suggestion of an object can be enough for the viewer to 'complete the scene' for
                themselves, with little effort of the artist. Human brains are well-trained in recognizing patterns
                based on their experiences, and as an artist, you should try and take advantage of this!</p>
            <p>For example, imagine you want to draw a castle in the background of your art...</p>
            <figure class="image-content">
                <img src="../images/art/ashes.png" alt="Ashes of Dreams by robotfish">
                <figcaption><i>Ashes of Dreams by robotfish</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure class="image-content-tall">
                <img src="../images/art/saber.jpg" alt="Saber by alchemaniac">
                <figcaption><i>Saber by alchemaniac</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Am I saying that being lazy all the time is a good thing? Probably not, and you should definitely
                challenge yourself from time to time in order to improve...</p>
            <p>Using and mastering these types of 'lazy' techniques doesn't make you less of an artist. I would rather
                argue, that if you know how to use this well enough, you have become a better artist. If you know the
                implications of leaving things vague, such as creating depth or changing the main focus of your work,
                you can use them to your advantage. Depending on the style and message you're going for, photo-realism
                is perhaps not the most important aspect of an artwork, especially in an era where we carry portable
                cameras around everywhere and can take a picture of whatever we like at any time. While photography is
                an art of its own, what is your interpretation of the object/character/scene?</p>
            <p>In other words, you don't even have to be an expert on landscapes, foliage, perspective, buildings, etc.
                to come up with a good background! Don't hesitate to experiment!</p>


            <h3>5. Building on Your Sketch</h3>
            <p>Now you've laid out the base and learned how suggestion can be a powerful tool, it's time to transform
                your idea into a final product. One of the reasons that you shouldn't get too attached to the sketch, or
                shouldn't be disappointed if the sketch doesn't look as spectacular as you had imagined it, is that it
                is a base, and not a final product. Creating backgrounds is a process, with learning moments, sudden
                ideas and revelations, struggles, problems and solutions.</p>

            <figure class="image-content">
                <img src="https://orig00.deviantart.net/a96a/f/2017/351/6/9/ibarahime_process_by_kirwet99-dbwztev.gif"
                    alt="Process gif of Cursed Slumber by kirwet99">
                <figcaption><i>Process gif of Cursed Slumber by kirwet99</i></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p><b>Light and Shadow, Depth</b></p>
            <p>The part that brings your background to life the most is adding depth through light and shadow. Keep in
                mind the light source that acts on the character and think about how it will affect the objects in the
                background. Add highlights and shadows accordingly, and your background will instantly look more '3D'.
            </p>

            <figure class="image-content">
                <img src="../images/art/chimera.jpg" alt="Chimera by kirwet99">
                <figcaption><i>Chimera by kirwet99</i><br>
                    The flames in the foreground cast light on the edge of the clock in the background. The
                    clockwork inside is mostly shielded by the foremost parts of the clock, thus appears darker.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p><b>Next up is Rendering!</b></p>
            <p>Rendering refers to paying attention to textures and structures of objects. Remember those references you
                gathered at the start? Now is the time to use them! (And probably find out you don't have enough and
                have to find more :'D ) While you've figured out the general light and dark areas previously, it is now
                time to think about how certain materials interact with light. For example, some surfaces like metal are
                very shiny, while some fabrics or untreated wood react to light in a very different way. If you're not
                sure, look up some more references and/or tutorials! The more practice you get with this, the easier it
                will become.</p>

            <figure class="image-content">
                <img src="../images/art/initial-layout.jpg" alt="Initial layout of background elements">
            </figure>
            <figure class="image-content">
                <img src="../images/art/detailed.jpg" alt="More detailed shapes">
                <figcaption>By adding lighting and more detailed shapes, the shapes in the first images appear more
                    like rock or leaves.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>And again, think about the power of suggestion. The viewer probably has a good idea of what the grass
                you're drawing should look like, but more importantly, the viewer knows what it shouldn't look like, as
                well. It's more pleasing to the eye if something is left more up to suggestion, than defined in an
                incorrect or unnatural way.</p>


            <h3>6. Immersing the Character(s) in the Scene</h3>
            <p>What I notice with a lot of artists (including myself), especially in the anime/manga style, is that they
                (used to) consider a background as an 'add-on' to their artwork; something you add at the end. As a
                result, it sometimes looks like the main subject of the drawing, for example the character, is just
                'pasted on top' of a background, instead of actually being part of the environment. In some cases,
                especially with simpler backgrounds such as colors and patterns, it's okay to add them at the end, but
                with more detailed ones, it is very important to think about it as a piece of the illustration that
                might be equally important as the subject (such as a character).</p>
            <p>This part is about how to make it look like your subject or character is actually a part of the
                environment in the background, instead of 'pasted on top of it'. There are many ways you can achieve
                this, and many technical aspects behind this...</p>

            <p><b>Careful of the Light!</b></p>
            <p>Lighting can often be a very strong, if not the most important, factor in making it believable that your
                character is part of the environment instead of just in front of it. Try to make sure that the light is
                coming from the same direction with both the character and objects in the background...</p>

            <p><b>Adding a Foreground</b></p>
            <p>I know this article was about backgrounds, but... aren't foregrounds essentially part of the background
                too?! Another easy way to immerse your character into the scene is through suggesting the background
                continues all around the character, which can be done with a foreground.</p>

            <figure class="image-content-tall">
                <img src="../images/art/princess_mechanism.png" alt="Princess Mechanism by batrez">

            <p><b>Dynamic Composition</b></p>
            <p>A dynamic composition does not only make your work more interesting, but can also help immersing your
                character in the background through showing that your character interacts with/has an impact on the
                background. Eg. if your character is a fire mage, you can add magic effects, but also show burning
                houses/trees in the background. </p>

            <p>Small Tricks that Can Add Dynamism to Your Work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Instead of having the horizon perfectly straight, slightly tilting it in the direction of motion or
                    contrary to the direction of motion.</li>
                <li>Having elements of your background follow motion lines (often used with clouds/skies, flames, magic
                    effects, for example).</li>
                <li>Tilting perspective in the direction of motion.</li>
                <li>Emphasizing certain areas with lighting.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Values, Enhancing the Character</b></p>
            <p>Since we already established that our brains are lazy and that they are focused on recognizing patterns,
                it's important to make a scene easy to read. The easiest way to do this is to make sure that the
                character has a clear silhouette against the background, and this can be done by creating a contrast in
                values. Values essentially refer to the lightness/darkness of a colour, without taking hue into account.
                In other words; think of your image as if it were in greyscale. Here are two quick tricks to check your
                values/the readability of the scene;</p>

            <p>If you zoom out very far, and look at the thumbnail version of your piece, is it still clear what
                the main features of your character are? (i.e. overall body shape, face, etc.)</p>
            <div class="images-side-by-side">
                <figure class="image-content-tall">
                    <img src="../images/art/eden.jpg" alt="Normal sized version of Eden by Kirwet99">

                </figure>
            </div>


            <p>If you change the settings to greyscale, is your character still clearly visible against the
                background? Do the lighter/darker values make your character stand apart enough to distinguish them
                from the background?</p>

            <h3>7. Finishing Touches</h3>
            <p>This part varies per artist, but most have their own final touches for backgrounds and/or their artworks
                to add that final touch. These are some final effects you could add and how you can use them to enhance
                your artwork!</p>

            <p><b>Blurs</b></p>
            <p>Using a blur to the background can help add depth and/or motion to your piece! By blurring certain areas
                of the background, you can also guide the eye of the viewer; they will automatically focus on the not
                blurred parts...</p>

            </figure>

            <p><b>Glows and Light Effects</b></p>
            <p>Like blurring, adding glows to objects can help guide the viewer's eye. This type of effect can vary from
                glowing orbs or shapes to add 'magic effect' or overall glows on an object. Glow effects can be really
                nice, but it's easy to overuse them. Try to use them to improve the readability of your
                artwork/background, instead of decreasing it. Some other light effects that are commonly used are
                sparkles and lens flares, I like to use them to accentuate that one detail in either the foreground or
                the background. Again, be careful not to overuse them!</p>

            </figure>


            <p><b>Textures and Patterns</b></p>
            <p>Some artists choose to enhance their image through giving it a texture, such as watercolor and/or paper
                textures, film grain and noise. Contrasting textures also help to enhance certain parts of the work and
                suggest different materials.</p>
            <figure class="image-content">
                <img src="../images/art/serenade.jpg" alt="Serenade by kidchan">
                <figcaption><i>Serenade by kidchan</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In this work by kidchan, the artist has made use of a texture to enhance the face and the
                hair of the character, while also integrating her in the background by letting the texture cover
                her clothes, as well.</p>


            <h3>8. Improving</h3>
            <p>The best advice I can give you when it comes to backgrounds is; just start. They might seem complicated
                and scary at first, but if you never start, you'll never improve on them, either.</p>
            <p>Something that can help a lot in terms of improving on backgrounds is doing some studies from real life,
                from time to time, even if you draw in a stylized style like anime/manga. By looking at references,
                you'll pick up useful practice with lighting, composition, and rendering of objects, and of course
                stylized styles are always to some extent based on reality! Even if your study ends up not looking like
                your reference at the start, there's always something that you have learned.</p>

            </figure>


            <p>Furthermore, now you know the ins and outs of backgrounds, you can study your favorite artists and just
                why their backgrounds work so well! It never hurts to try and incorporate that in your own work...</p>
            <p>Backgrounds are artworks of their own, and require just as a complex skill set as creating an entire
                piece. So at the start, of course it's overwhelming to work with very detailed and complex backgrounds,
                and of course it's okay to go easy on yourself from time to time as well. But the good news on the other
                hand is that as you improve as an artist, you'll automatically improve on backgrounds, as well!</p>
