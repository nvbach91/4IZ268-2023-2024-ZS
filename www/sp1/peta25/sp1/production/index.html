            <h2>The Evolution and Unique Techniques of Anime Production</h2>
            <p>Modern anime follows a typical animation production process, involving storyboarding, voice acting,
                character design, and cel production. Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer
                animation to improve the efficiency of the production process. Early anime works were experimental, and
                consisted of images drawn on blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette
                animation. Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. In the 21st century,
                the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films, including the stop
                motion puppet animation work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga, Kihachirō Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata.
                Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as Ghost in the Shell
                and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with computer-generated images. Fuji Film, a major cel
                production company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel
                imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.</p>
            <p>Prior to the digital era, anime was produced with traditional animation methods using a pose to pose
                approach. The majority of mainstream anime uses fewer expressive key frames and more in-between
                animation.</p>
            <p>Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many limited animation techniques, and have given anime a
                distinct set of conventions. Unlike Disney animation, where the emphasis is on the movement, anime
                emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on
                movement. Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices. Anime
                scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views, and backgrounds are instrumental in creating
                the atmosphere of the work. The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real
                locations, as exemplified in Howl's Moving Castle and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Oppliger stated
                that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast usually comes out looking
                "tremendously impressive".</p>
            <p>The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in American animation.
                Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera, including panning, zooming, distance and angle shots to
                more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality. In anime, the animation is
                produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first.

            <h2>How is Anime Created?</h2>
            <p>Obviously, each studio takes its own unique approach to making their shows, but just about every anime
                has to go through the same general steps.</p>
            <h3>1. Idea</h3>
            <p>Every anime has to start with a story idea. There are three main sources of story for anime: manga, light
                novels, and original scripts. Obviously, story ideas can come from anywhere, but popular manga and books
                in Japan make a lot of sense to use since they already have a fanbase.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, any story has to be converted to a script suitable for the anime medium; taking into account
                episodic length, story pacing, and other unique issues not faced by mangaka and novelists. The director,
                along with the writers, are key figures in getting the script into shape. Once the studio in question is
                happy with the script it will greenlight the project and pre-production will begin.</p>


            <h3>2. The Pre-production Phase</h3>
            <p>“Pre-production” is the phase of the project before anyone has actually started making the show. All film
                and television projects have a pre-production phase; the length of this can vary widely, based on
                several factors such as how big the project is going to be, how much money is needed, and so on.
                Pre-production begins from where the pitch or idea for a new anime happens up to the point where the
                animation itself is ready to start production. All the project planning and financial preparation
                happens here. Licensing of story rights, hiring of the right people, and getting investment from various
                sources are jobs done by the producers of the show. They are the ones who need to line everything up so
                the actual show can be made. It is a daunting task.</p>
            <p>The director plays an important role in this. He or she will be part of pre-production because they have
                the say when it comes to hiring the rest of the production crew. Just as in Hollywood, to fill key
                positions directors will hire people they trust and have worked with before. Directors are the creative
                head of the project; not the business head. So they have to work with the budgets and deadlines agreed
                upon with the producers.</p>
            <p>Different studios have different staffing situations as well. There might be a core of in-house staff
                augmented by contractors as projects come and go. Once the money, people, and facilities are agreed upon
                the actual production part can begin.</p>

            <h3>3. About Animation</h3>
            <p>In case you didn’t know, animation works by quickly flipping through drawings of different phases of
                motion in order to create the illusion of actual motion. Film works the same way, but each “frame” is a
                photograph rather than a drawing. I’m just mentioning it, because keeping the nature of animation in
                mind will allow the next phases to make more sense.</p>

            <h3>4. Storyboards</h3>
            <p>The script describes the story in terms of scenes and dialogue, but it’s not a visual representation. The
                director needs to turn the script into a visual guide in order to communicate to the animators exactly
                what he wants.</p>
            <p>That’s where a “storyboard” comes in. This is a set of rough sketches that detail what is meant to happen
                in each scene. It also shows what scene layouts should look like and so on. There may also be concept
                art if the story doesn’t already have visual design, as a manga would.</p>

            <h3>5. Creating Layout</h3>
            <p>Since this is animation, there’s no actual “camera” filming scenes. Instead, “layouts” are created from
                the storyboard that show what the background and perspective should look like, where cuts will happen,
                and how the “camera” will move. Layout design is where animation production really begins.</p>



            <h3>6. Key Animation</h3>
            <p>The layouts are given to the key animators. They will create high-quality key frames. That is, the first
                and last frame of any smooth motion on screen, such as someone turning their head, pulling back for a
                punch, changing facial expression, and so on.</p>
            <p>The key frames are therefore the backbone of the animation and serve as a reference throughout the
                animation process. In order to create the illusion of smooth motion, films present us with 24 frames a
                second or more. This would imply that you need 24 drawings for each second of animation! Since there are
                typically only two or three key frames per second of anime, those extra frames have to come from
                somewhere.</p>

            <h3>7. In Between Artists</h3>
            <p>The unenviable job of drawing all those frames goes to another type of animator called an “in-between”
                artist. As you’ve probably figured out, this person draws all the frames between the key frames. This is
                a less senior artist and the work is often outsourced to cheap labor in places like South Korea. While
                the key frame artists have to actually create the original animation design and objects, the in-between
                artist has those key frames as reference, which makes their job easier, in principle. It’s still
                grueling work that requires a lot of talent. In-between artists are often very poorly paid, as are most
                people in the anime industry, to be honest.</p>
            <p>Luckily they don’t have to draw every single frame for every second of footage. Drawing a separate cel
                for every single frame in a given second is referred to as “animating on ones” in the industry. That
                sort of fluid motion is only reserved for big budget productions or for specific scenes (such as fights)
                that justify the extra effort. Most of the time, a show will be animated on “twos” or even “threes”. In
                other words, only every second or third frame is animated.</p>
            <p>It’s with in-between animation that most quality issues arrive, and so they are all quality controlled by
                a dedicated supervisor. Still, some shows such as Naruto, with its insane production schedule, let some
                truly weird in-betweens slip through every now and then – something fans will capture and post on the
                internet with glee.</p>

            <h3>8. Going Digital</h3>
            <p>These days, regardless of how animation starts it inevitably ends up as digital media. Once the animation
                teams are done, everything needs to be colored. The colored cels are put against the backgrounds as per
                the layouts. In modern anime this is also where CG elements are added. Now everything must be filmed
                together as a composite to create the final video.</p>

            <h3>9. After Animation Ends/ Giving it a Voice?</h3>
            <p>Anime aren’t silent movies! This means there’s still quite a lot to do. The voice artists need to breathe
                life into the characters, so final or near-final animation is sent to the dubbing studio where voice
                tracks can be created. We still also need things like ambient sound, sound effects, music, and any other
                audio work such as mixing and mastering to be done.</p>
            <p>After all this work, your episode is basically ready to ship out, and then you get to start the whole
                process all over again!</p>

            <h3>10. Real-life Reality</h3>
            <p>I hope it’s clear that these are just the broad strokes of anime production. There’s a lot more fine
                detail that there simply isn’t space enough here to go through. This is also a sort of naive order and
                clinical description. In real life, anime projects can be chaotic and follow their own weird order and
                schedule. So don’t think of this as a recipe for making anime, but rather a list of main ingredients.
                Each studio will bake their anime in a different way.</p>
            <p>Things are also changing rapidly. There’s a move towards full CG animation, where 3D cel-shaded graphics
                are used for everything in the show. Sometimes this works very well, but many new CG anime shows (such
                as the Berserk reboot) look pretty awful. It’s a technology that studios are only slowly learning to use
                properly. When done right, such as in Knights of Sidonia, it can look great. However, there will always
                be a certain charm to hand-drawn 2D characters.</p>
            <p>Making anime is largely a thankless job. Japanese animators get paid very little and have to work brutal
                hours; yet they possess amazing artistic talent. This is not a career you get into to make a ton of
                money. It’s an art driven by passion, and knowing how this particular sausage is made helps us
                appreciate it even more.

            <h2>About The Animators Themselves</h2>

            <h3>What is an Animator?</h3>
            <p>An animator is an artist that uses computer software and other technology to create a series of
                images that form animation. This allows them to make media like movies, television shows and video
                games. Animators typically specialize in one style of animation but can be familiar with different
                forms. They may also work with other creative professionals, such as artists and storytellers.</p>
