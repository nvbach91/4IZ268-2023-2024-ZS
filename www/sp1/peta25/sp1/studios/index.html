            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>An animation studio is a company producing animated media. The broadest such companies conceive of
                products to produce, own the physical equipment for production, employ operators for that equipment, and
                hold a major stake in the sales or rentals of the media produced. They also own rights over
                merchandising and creative rights for characters created/held by the company, much like authors holding
                copyrights. In some early cases, they also held patent rights over methods of animation used in certain
                studios that were used for boosting productivity. Overall, they are business concerns and can function
                as such in legal terms.</p>

            <h2>Japanese studios</h2>
            <p>Japanese studios, the beating heart of this industry, craft original anime series and successful
                productions at an astonishing rate. These studios function not merely as production houses but as
                full-fledged Japanese entertainment companies. Among these, you'll find names that have stretched their
                influence beyond their home country, partnering with global giants like Universal Pictures to expand
                their reach. These alliances bridge the gap between traditional Japanese comics and their animated
                counterparts, thus contributing to the evolution of the industry.</p>

            <h3>Madhouse</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1972, Madhouse Studio is one of the longest-running Japanese anime studios. It was started by
                four very talented animators – Osamu Dezaki, Rintaro, Yoshiaki Kawajiri and Masao Maruyama – who were
                all previously working at Osamu Tezuka’s Mushi Production Studio.
                Right from the beginning Madhouse were
                producing incredible series and films, and that trend continues to this day. Notable Madhouse
                productions include <i>Death Note</i>, <i>One-Punch Man</i>, <i>Claymore</i>, and <i>Cardcaptor
                    Sakura</i>.
                Madhouse has a reputation for bringing on board stellar directors, with one standout
                example being Satoshi Kon. Madhouse was the anime studio responsible for all four of Kon’s highly
                acclaimed films – <i>Perfect Blue</i>, <i>Paprika</i>, <i>Millennium Actress</i>, and <i>Tokyo
                    Godfathers</i>. Madhouse is also known for attracting well-known manga artists, such as Clamp and
                Naoki Urasawa. As well as collaborating with other Japanese animation studios, Madhouse also
                collaborates with international studios. For example, it worked with Marvel on various animation series
                like <i>X-Men</i> and <i>Wolverine</i>.</p>

            <h3>Studio Bones</h3>
            <p>Like several other studios on this list, Studio Bones was founded by members of a former studio. In this
                case, the former studio was Sunrise Inc., and the former members were Masahiko Minami, Hiroshi Osaka and
                Toshihiro Kawamoto. They broke away and started Studio Bones in 1998, and have since been behind some
                hit anime series, such as <i>Full Metal Alchemist</i>, <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> and <i>My Hero
                    Academia</i>. There was no bad blood between Studio Bones and Sunrise Inc., and the studios would go
                on to collaborate with each other on 2001’s <i>Cowboy Bebop: The Movie</i>. Tragically, founding member
                Hiroshi Osaka passed away from cancer in 2007 at the age of 44. After this, Makoto Watanabe and Takahiro
                Komori were brought on to the board of directors. Studio Bones has a reputation as a reliable studio
                that is capable of handling any kind of job.</p>

            <h3>Kyoto Animation</h3>
            <p>Founded way back in 1981, Kyoto Animation is another long-running animation studio with a rich history.
                It was founded by a married couple, Yoko and Hideaki Hatta, and is named after the Kyoto Prefecture,
                where it is based. The ethos of Kyoto differs from that of other animation studios. Rather than using
                freelancers in the production process, Kyoto has a team of salaried animators on staff. The emphasis is
                placed on producing good work instead of meeting production quotas. Offering in-house training and
                providing job security is far from the norm in Japanese anime. This approach has led Kyoto Animation to
                develop a recognizable style, and the studio has produced a range of high-quality and popular anime,
                including <i>The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</i>, <i>Free!</i>, <i>Clannad</i>, <i>A Silent Voice</i>,
                and more. In a further twist in the Kyoto tale, its studio burnt down in 2019, resulting in the loss of
                life and a huge amount of resources. It has since rebuilt itself, and seeing it back in action is
                heartwarming.</p>

            <h3>Wit Studio</h3>
            <p>This subsidiary studio of Production IG is a relative newcomer in the world of Japanese anime, but it has
                managed to make a big impact in a short space of time. Founded in 2012 by Tetsuya Nakatake, Wit Studio
                got to work soon after on its first popular anime series, an anime adaption of Hajime Isayama’s manga
                <i>Attack on Titan</i>. The first series of <i>Attack on Titan</i> hit the screens in 2013, and in no
                time at all, it was being held up as one of the best anime series of all time. Wit Studio went on to
                produce two more seasons of <i>Attack on Titan</i>, before it went to MAPPA Studios for the fourth
                season. Other notable projects include <i>Vinland Saga</i>, <i>Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress</i>, and
                <i>The Ancient Magus Bride</i>. The studio is well regarded for its ability to create a distinctive art
                style for any show it is working on.
            </p>

            <h3>Toei Animation</h3>
            <p>If the name Toei Animation doesn’t ring any bells right now, the shows that it has produced certainly
                will – <i>Dragon Ball Z</i> and <i>Sailor Moon</i> are two Toei Animation productions that went on to
                have huge global success and become part of the pop culture fabric. Toei is also behind the animated
                series <i>One Piece</i> and its spin-off movies, one of the longest-running anime shows of all time. The
                history of Toei Animation goes way back, and it is one of the first anime studios to have ever existed.
                It was founded in 1948 and originally called Japan Animated Films. In 1956 it was bought over by Toei
                Company and the name was changed, first to Toei Doga in Japan and Toei Animation in the rest of the
                world, and then in 1998, Toei Doga also became known as Toei Animation. Its first animated film,
                <i>Kitty’s Graffiti</i>, was released in 1957 and its first animated series, <i>Wolf Boy Ken</i>, was
                released in 1963. Since then, Toei Animation has released hundreds of anime shows, and it remains one of
                the biggest names in Japanese animation today.
            </p>

            <h3>MAPPA Studio</h3>
            <p>MAPPA Studio was founded in 2011 by former Madhouse employee Masao Maruyama, and the name stands for
                Maruyama Animation Project Produce Association. Maruyama's reason for breaking away and starting his own
                studio is that he wanted to escape the corporate trappings he was experiencing at Madhouse, and instead
                do projects where he had more creative freedom. MAPPA Studio found instant success with its first anime,
                <i>Kids on the Slope</i>, and it has been consistently producing big hits ever since, including
                <i>Yuri!! On Ice</i>, <i>Banana Fish</i>, <i>Jujutsu Kaisen</i> and the final season of the popular
                series <i>Attack on Titan</i>. In an ironic twist of fate, the studio’s success led it to become one of
                the most popular animation studios, which meant it developed the same kind of pressures that Maruyama
                left Madhouse to avoid. In 2016, Maruyama decided to exit the company and leave it in younger hands, so
                Manabu Otsuka took over as CEO, and MAPPA Studio has continued to thrive.
            </p>

            <h3>Studio Ghibli</h3>
            <p>Studio Ghibli is a huge name not just in anime films, but in film in general. The studio has a reputation
                for producing some of the most successful films of all time – not just in terms of anime movies, but ALL
                movies. Co-founded and headed up by the legendary director Hayao Miyazaki, Studio Ghibli is behind eight
                of the 15 highest-grossing Japanese anime films of all time. The studio has not had just staggering
                commercial success, it has also won a legion of awards, including the Oscar for Best Animated Feature
                film for <i>Spirited Away</i> in 2003. A combination of powerful and emotive storytelling with beautiful
                and stunning animation is a feature of Studio Ghibli’s work, and it often tackles bigger themes deftly.
                There are too many amazing anime titles to mention, but some standout movies are <i>Princess
                    Mononoke</i>, <i>My Neighbour Totoro</i>, <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i>, and <i>Howls’ Moving
                    Castle</i>. A true treasure of a studio.</p>

            <h3>Sunrise Studio</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1972 by ex-employees of Mushi Production, Sunrise has since become one of the largest anime
                studios of all time. Sunrise now has more than 10 separate sub-studios working on different anime
                projects. The studio is best known for its focus on the mecha-anime genre, and it has produced huge
                mecha-anime hits like the <i>Gundam</i> series and its offshoots. The studio doesn’t confine itself to
                mecha-anime and has produced other renowned series, such as the classic <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> and
                <i>Outlaw Star</i>. An interesting fact about Sunrise is that many of its employees have gone on to
                start their own studios. A total of six different former Sunrise employees have taken this path. This
                shouldn’t be taken as a failing of Sunrise but rather a sign that the studio knows how to spot and
                nurture some of the best talent in anime.
            </p>

            <h3>A-1 Pictures</h3>
            <p>A-1 Pictures is one of the studios that was started by a former Sunrise employee. Producer Mikihiro Iwata
                left Sunrise back in 2005 to set up A-1 Pictures. The studio is a division of Aniplex, which is Sony
                Music Entertainment Japan’s anime production company. To begin with, the studio produced a lot of
                family-friendly anime, but over time it has diversified into other styles. Some of the most notable
                projects that A-1 Pictures has produced include <i>Fairy Tail</i>, <i>Sword Art Online</i>, <i>Black
                    Butler</i> and <i>Seven Deadly Sins</i>.</p>

            <h3>Ufotable</h3>
            <p>Ufotable was founded in 2000 by former employees of TMS Entertainment’s Telecom Animation Film division.
                While it is a relatively new studio, it still has a number of notable productions under its belt, plus a
                huge success, which we’ll get to. It released its first anime series in 2002, and since then it has
                produced standout anime series such as <i>God Eater</i> and <i>Fate/Zero</i>. But what put Ufotable on
                the map and made them a big name was the <i>Demon Slayer</i> series and films. <i>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu
                    no Yaiba</i> was a hugely successful series based on the original manga and written by Ufotable
                staff. The film <i>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba: The Infinity Train</i>, was released as a direct
                sequel to the first series of the anime show. It became the highest-grossing Japanese film of 2020, then
                took the mantle as the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time. Pretty good going!</p>

            <h3>Studio Pierrot</h3>
            <p>This Japanese animation studio was founded in 1979. Like many other studios, it was started by former
                employees of other animation studios. In this case, the employees were from Tatsunoko Production and
                Mushi Production. Studio Pierrot takes its name from the classic character Pierrot, which means ‘clown’
                in Japanese, and is based in Mitaka, Tokyo. The studio has produced many popular anime series, including
                <i>Naruto</i>, <i>Yu Yu Hakusho</i>, <i>Black Clover</i>, <i>Tokyo Ghoul</i> and more. Two of the anime
                series produced by the company – <i>Saiyuki</i> and <i>Yu Yu Hakusho</i> – have gone on to win Animage
                Anime Grand Prix Awards, which is always a mark of quality.
            </p>

            <h3>Production I.G</h3>
            <p>Production I.G was founded in 1987 by producer Mitsuhisa Ishikawa and character designer Takayuki Goto,
                and the name is derived from their initials. The studio is known not only for its anime series and films
                but also for its work in video game design. Some of the most popular titles that Production I.G has
                worked on include <i>Kuroko’s Basketball</i>, <i>Psycho-Pass</i>, and <i>Eden of the East</i>, but the
                best-known anime the studio produced is, without a doubt, <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>. The <i>Ghost in the
                    Shell</i> anime series was a massive hit, and the feature film of the same name was an international
                sensation that even went on to get a Hollywood live-action version. The studio has also earned a
                reputation as one of the pioneers of CG in anime, which has become more of an industry standard since it
                blazed the trail. A fun Production I.G fact is that the studio produced the animations in Quentin
                Tarantino’s <i>Kill Bill Vol. 1</i>. There are many more studios who contributed to the industry such as
                Studio Trigger, P.A.Works or J.C.Staff. </p>
