            <p>Once upon a time, in a distant land, there lived a clever and skillful wizard named Linus. Linus enjoyed
                inventing new spells that would help people in their everyday lives. One day, he managed to create the
                most
                amazing spell of all - a spell that allowed people to collaborate in creating more spells. Linus named
                this
                spell Linux and decided to gift it to the world.
            </p>
            <p>Linux was very simple and flexible. Anyone who wanted to use it could customize it to their needs and
                desires. Linux also allowed people to share their modifications with others and contribute to improving
                Linux. Soon, Linux became a very popular and widely used spell that people from various fields and
                interests
                used. Linux helped doctors treat illnesses, teachers educate their students, artists create works,
                scientists discover new things, and many others.</p>
            <p>Linus was very happy that his spell brought so much joy and utility to people. He was also proud that
                Linux
                was open and free. This meant that no one could control or misuse Linux. Linux belonged to everyone, and
                anyone could contribute to its development. Linus hoped that Linux would exist forever and inspire
                people to
                collaborate, be creative, and be charitable.</p>
            <p>And so, Linus lived happily until his death, and his spell Linux became a legend.</p>
            <p>The end.</p>
