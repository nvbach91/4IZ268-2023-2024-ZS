                <h3>sort command</h3>
                <p>The sort command is used generally to sort the output of the file. Letâ€™s use the command and see the
                    output.</p>

                <h3>wc command</h3>
                <p>wc command in Linux indicates the number of words, characters, lines, etc using a set of options.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>wc -w shows the number of words</li>
                    <li>wc -l shows the number of lines</li>
                    <li>wc -m shows the number of characters present in a file</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>tr command</h3>
                <p>The command 'tr' stands for 'translate'. It is used to translate, like from lowercase to uppercase
                    and
                    vice versa or new lines into spaces.</p>

                <h3>cut command</h3>
                <p>Linux cut command is useful for selecting a specific column of a file. It is used to cut a specific
                    sections by byte position, character, and field and writes them to standard output. It cuts a line
                    and
                    extracts the text data. It is necessary to pass an argument with it; otherwise, it will throw an
                    error
                    message. To cut a specific section, it is necessary to specify the delimiter. A delimiter will
                    decide
                    how the
                    sections are separated in a text file. Delimiters can be a space (' '), a hyphen (-), a slash (/),
                    or
                    anything else. After '-f' option, the column number is mentioned.</p>

                <h3>uniq command</h3>
                <p>Linux uniq command is used to remove all the repeated lines from a file. Also, it can be used to
                    display
                    a count of any word, only repeated lines, ignore characters, and compare specific fields. It is one
                    of
                    the most frequently used commands in the Linux system. It is often used with the sort command
                    because it
                    compares adjacent characters. It discards all the identical lines and writes the output.</p>

                <h3>grep command</h3>
                <p>The 'grep' command stands for "global regular expression print". grep command filters the content of
                    a
                    file which makes our search easy. It is a command-line utility to search plain-text data groups for
                    lines that are the same as a regular
                    expression. The name "grep" comes from the command, i.e., ed, which contains the same effect.
                    Originally, grep was designed for the Unix operating system, but it became available for every
                    Unix-like
                    system later and a few others like OS 9. The grep filter finds a file for a specific character
                    pattern
                    and shows every line that includes that
                    pattern. Characters should be in quotation marks if they occur in the pattern parameter with a
                    special
                    meaning for the shell. Usually, we must enclose the whole pattern in one quotation mark if the
                    pattern
                    parameter is not a common string. In an expression like [a-z], the minus sign (-) cml describes a
                    range
                    based on the current collating
                    order. A collating order may specify equivalent classes in character ranges for use. The grep
                    command
                    assumes stdin when no files are mentioned. The pattern is called the regular expression that is
                    found
                    inside the file. The pattern is restricted
                    regular expressions in the format of the egrep or ed command. The grep command applies a solid
                    non-deterministic algorithm. It comes in handy when we need to filter large log files.</p>
