                    <h3 id="Debian">Debian</h3>
                    <p>Debian is an open source operating system. This distribution was first announced by Ian Murdock
                        in
                        1993
                        as the “Debian Linux Release”. The Debian Project is a community of developers and users that
                        maintain
                        the GNU OS based on open source software. Currently, Debian systems use the Linux kernel or the
                        FreeBSD
                        kernel. However, they are also working on providing Debian for other kernels. Primarily, GNU
                        Hurd.

                    <h3 id="Fedora">Fedora</h3>
                    <p>Fedora is a Linux distribution developed by the Fedora Project — sponsored mainly by Red Hat,
                        with
                        support from other companies. It is developed and maintained by the community and it is an
                        upstream
                        source of the commercial RHEL distribution. Fedora usually has more modern software versions,
                        considered
                        as “non stable”, that are later included in RHEL. There are different Fedora editions available:
                        Workstation, Server, CoreOS, Silverblue and IoT. Fedora Linux was launched in 2003.</p>

                    <p>Arch Linux is a Linux distribution based on 5 principles: simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user
                        centrality and versatility. It features a rolling release model.</p>

                    <h3 id="Ubuntu">Ubuntu</h3>
                    <p>Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian. It is developed by Canonical and a community of
                        developers. It has 3 official editions: Desktop, Server and Core, which can either run on a
                        computer
                        or
                        on a VM. More than 34% of the websites using Linux use Ubuntu, according to W3Techs data. Its
                        growth
                        since 2010 has been amazing. It is also a popular distribution among cloud computing projects.

                    <h3 id="RHEL">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)</h3>
                    <p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a commercial Linux distribution developed by Red Hat. It has a
                        server
                        version and a desktop version. As it uses open source software, published under a General Public
                        License, they make their code available to the public via CentOS. Red Hat has sponsored the
                        CentOS
                        project since 2014.

                    <h3 id="CentOS">CentOS Linux</h3>
                    <p>CentOS Linux is a distribution based on the source code of the commercial distribution Red Hat
                        Enterprise
                        Linux (RHEL). It was launched in 2004 and is backed up by a growing community. It is a safe bet
                        for
                        those looking for high-quality code. But CentOS 8 will be its last version. In 2019, Red Hat
                        announced
                        that CentOS Linux would be replaced by CentOS Stream — an upstream development platform for
                        RHEL.
                        New
                        open source alternatives have appeared due to this change of strategy. For instance, Rocky
                        Linux,
                        founded by Gregory Kurtzer, founder of the CentOS project.</p>

                    <h3 id="Gentoo">Gentoo</h3>
                    <p>Gentoo is a Linux distribution that features a rolling release model. Gentoo Linux was originally
                        created
                        by Daniel Robbins. It was named after the fast-swimming “gentoo penguin”, to reflect its
                        potential.
                        It
                        is an attractive choice for Linux users looking for full control of the software. Gentoo users
                        have
                        great control over the services installed and running on their computer. They can immensely
                        customize
                        and optimize their system.</p>

                        companies.
                        It was formerly known as SUSE Linux. OpenSUSE has a rolling release version, Tumbleweed, and a
                        regular
                        release version, Leap.</p>

                    <p>Linux Mint is a community-driven Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. This distribution started in
                        2006.
                        The Linux Mint project was initially created by Clément Lefèbvre. Linux Mint OS’ source code is
                        available on GitHub. Most of the OS development is done in Python. </p>

                    <p>Slackware is one of the oldest Linux distributions, created by Patrick Volkerding in 1993. Many
                        Linux
                        distributions have been based on Slackware; for instance, the first versions of the SUSE Linux
                        distribution. It was originally based on the Softlanding Linux System (SLS), one of the most
                        popular
                        original Linux distributions.</p>
