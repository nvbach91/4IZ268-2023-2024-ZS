            ANDRÉ 3000 ADMITS HE DOESN'T 'EVEN KNOW'<br>
            WHAT NOTES HE'S PLAYING ON THE FLUTE

            André 3000 plays the flute from his heart... not from the sheet music. <br><br>

            During an interview with CBS Mornings, André opened up about his love for the flute and his lyric-free
            album,
            New Blue Sun.
            <br><br>

            “I’ve gotten so used to it I kinda have a muscle memory of holding [the flute],” he said. “When I’m walking
            with
            people that’s what they say, ‘I feel like I’m in my movie.
            <br><br>
            “I don’t even know what notes I’m playing so every move for me is new,” he continued, “Which is kinda crazy
            but
            it feels great to do it. Because when you find things you’re like, ‘Oh!'”

            <br><br>
            Andre credits hip-hop for his passion for finding new sounds. “It’s like a reward for searching. I think
            that’s
            a Hip Hop thing, to be honest. Because Hip Hop you immediately take something in and put it back out.”
            <br><br>


            We previously reported that the former Outkast member explained why he didn't participate in any hip-hop 50
            celebrations. “I wouldn’t want to be — I’m doing it just because I’m trying to meet an expectation. I didn’t
            get
            into OutKast for that, you know."
