      <h3>Ed Sheeran Gets Seasonally Emo on ‘Autumn Variations’</h3>

      

      <p class="albumsheeran"> In his Rolling Stone cover story from this April, Ed Sheeran revealed the existence of
        another full Aaron
        Dessner-produced project that came out of the sessions for – (Subtract), which the singer-songwriter released in
        May. Sheeran didn’t have clear-cut goals for the album at the time. But, like his friend Taylor Swift, it seems
        he has hit a special stride working with Dessner. Just four months after the release of (Subtract), Autumn
        Variations is here. It’s Sheeran in just-in-time-for-fall mode, a collection of reflective songs with melodies
        that swirl like eddying leaves and lyrics full of pumpkin-ale introspection that often dwell on the seasonal
        nature of personal growth.
        <br><br>
        With Autumn Variations, Sheeran has entered a new season of his own life: His seventh studio album is the first
        outside of the mathematical symbol thread that connected his earlier work, and the first LP off the British
        songwriter’s label, Gingerbread Man Records. But in looking forward, he hasn’t left the past behind entirely, as
        many of the album’s songs bring to mind the sweet simplicity of his earlier 2010s albums, + (Plus) and x
        (Multiply), though with a mature twist. The LP is inspired by Sheeran’s friends “going through so many life
        changes,” and is directly influenced by the work of 20th-century English composer Edward Elgar’s similarly
        themed Enigma Variations. In a statement, Sheeran explained, “After the heat of the summer, everything either
        calmed, settled, fell apart, came to a head, or imploded.”
        <br><br>
        On Autumn Variations, the storytelling skills that paved the way for Sheeran’s mainstream success are on full
        display. “Plastic Bag” psychoanalyzes a hedonistic friend who tries to find the cure to their depression at the
        bottom of plastic drug baggies. Similarly, “Spring” and “When Will I Be Alright” are about clawing your way out
        of despair with soft, acoustic melodies as a salve against sorrow. In the guitar-plucked “Page,” a selfish
        friend is stuck in the throes of a broken relationship they’re at fault for ending: “For a moment of glory, I
        would risk all I am,” Sheeran sings. Another friend suffers a piercing heartbreak in “Punchline,” as Sheeran
        belts with unrestrained energy over a rock-infused crescendo that might bring to mind Hozier’s sweeping indie
        folk.
