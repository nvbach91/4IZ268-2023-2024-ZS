    <h2 class="headline50producers">50 YEARS OF HIP HOP, ACCORDING TO MC'S</h2>
    <h3 class="pruducents2">
      Several influential artists and newcomers spokeabout hip-hop's biggest milestone to date, 50 years after it was
      born in the Bronx. </h3>


    <h2 class="pruducents2">A$AP Ferg</h2>

    <p>"They thought that we wasn't gonna be here that long in the beginning. It's just creating so many rich people,
      seeing so many families... If I wasn't doing hip-hop, I don't know what I'd be doing right now to be honest. I
      tried every job in the world. Hip-hop seemed to stick. Thank you, hip-hop." </p>

    <h2 class="pruducents2">DJ Khaled</h2>


    <p>"It means everything to me. I was born into hip-hop, I live hip-hop, I breathe hip-hop, I bleed hip-hop, I rep
      hip-hop, I am hip-hop. This is my life forever. And hip-hop is a lifestyle. I dress hip-hop, I talk hip-hop. I'm a
      hip-hop father. So for it to be 50 years old, it's such a blessing. And I'm just so grateful to be a part of such
      a beautiful culture from musically to lifestyle, to energy, and to inspiration and motivation. You know what I'm
      saying? To be able to tell our stories from songs to instruments, to drums, to clothing, to lingo, hip-hop is
      everything. You know what I'm saying? Hip-hop is everything to me."</p>

    <h2 class="pruducents2">DMC (Darryl McDaniels) of RUN-DMC</h2>


    <p> "At first the feeling was like, 'This is me.' It wasn't like, 'Here's this thing called hip-hop and they rap.'
      It wasn't that. You heard it and immediately every cell and atom in your body said, 'This is me…'

      I was in Catholic school. I went to Catholic school. I was in seventh grade at Catholic school and an eighth
      grader kid, Billy Morris, had it in a tape recorder. There was no boomboxes yet. It was no big gold chains, big
      earrings. It was tape recorders. And people in Queens was getting the live tapes of what was going on in the
      Bronx, Manhattan and Harlem, and people was dubbing the tapes and selling them like records, like albums.

      But I was in seventh grade and when I heard the beat and the guy rapping... But it was also very inspirational.
      See, that's what people forget. It was like there was death, darkness, and destruction. There was crime. The Bronx
      was burning. 42nd Street was just porno shops. It wasn't Disney like it is today. So New York could be a very
      depressing place at that time, but when you heard this music, it made you brighten up. It made you see
      possibilities.

      But it was, 'Yo, this is me. This sound is how I feel. It's scary. It's New York. It's crime and heroin and gangs,
      but that sound is how I really feel inside. Everything else is just a front to cope and make it through.' So I was
      a little Catholic school kid. I was nerdy and geeky. But to sum it up, it made me feel powerful."</p>


    <h2 class="pruducents2">Fabolous</h2>


    <p>"I hope it keeps evolving. I hope the art is appreciated inside the game and outside the game. What I mean by
      inside is, let artists be artists. Also, they deserve to own their art. When you’re an artist painting something,
      they own it, they made it."</p>

    <h2 class="pruducents2">Ja Rule</h2>

    <p>"Hip-hop has been through anything. Similar to rock and roll. It’s grown up right in front of our eyes. I’m not
      that old to have seen rock n roll grow up. But there are people who are still here that can say they have. But for
      me that’s hip-hop. I’m 47, hip-hop’s 50. I was right there. I was there to watch a lot of it."</p>

    <h2 class="pruducents2">Latto</h2>


    <p> "Hip-hop is more than music. It's a way of life, it's a culture. Hip-hop has influenced even other genres of
      music. We teach people how to dress through our music. We tell them what liquor they should be drinking, and what
      clubs they should be at, where they should go for vacation. It's literally so much deeper than music, and I'm
      very, very honored to be a part of the genre.

      It's been a long time coming for women in rap. I think it is just my duty to do that. We've been going 10 times as
      hard for equal recognition as the men, and I just think it's my responsibility to bring others up as I go. I see
      how hard they work and how hard we have to go to literally just get equal recognition. So it's like, ‘Let me do my
      part.’

      I hope that I'm leaving behind a legacy of just confidence and empowerment for women, and maybe just like an
      escape from your everyday life and just turn on some Latto and feel empowered, feel like anything is possible, and
      I'm not taking no for an answer."
    </p>

    <h2 class="pruducents2">Lil Baby</h2>


    <p>"Hip-hop means a lot to me and it's amazing that I could be a part of 50 years of hip-hop, and a good part of
      it." </p>


    <h2 class="pruducents2">NLE Choppa</h2>


    <p> "Hip-hop saved my life. Music saved my life. Just to be able to come out here and rap these lyrics, it means a
      lot to me because I know it helped me through the toughest times. Music saved my life.

      Having somebody to grace hip-hop like Tupac changed everything. Having someone that could come in there and stand
      for something deeper than music and at the same time give you great music. That changed hip-hop forever. " </p>

    <h2 class="pruducents2">Pusha-T</h2>


    <p>"Man, 50 years of hip-hop, it's a milestone that that's so many people thought we would never see. I remember
      being a kid into hip-hop and my parents telling me, man, 'What is all this bippity-bop and hippity-hop, this ain't
      real music.' And I have all of those memories and basically being told that it would not be here in another five
      years. And here we are at 50."</p>

    <h2 class="pruducents2">Salt of Salt-N-Pepa</h2>



    <p>"For me being in this genre and so successful for so many years, it is still mind blown emoji, because we are
      booked and busy. And I knew Salt-N-Pepa were going to be a success, I just always believed that. But I never
      thought in my mind that we would be in our 50s and still traveling and performing probably just as much as we ever
      did. So that's a testament to the power of the culture and how much people embrace it and love it. When we do
      shows and we see '90s babies, '80s babies, millennials, Gen Z, knowing our songs, it's just like, "What are you
      guys doing here?" They're there with the grandma, the mom and the daughter. Three generations we get sometimes.
      So, it's a blessing."</p>

    <h2 class="pruducents2">Slick Rick</h2>


    <p> "Fifty years of hip-hop means that hip-hop and more greatness will continue... We now have our own culture, its
      own museum (UHHM) and our own union has been formed (HHA).

      Hip-hop is the pulpit of the people. Hip-hop started out as the voice of the creatives of the bottom. Hip-hop is
      the purest art form that brings that melting pot of community together via (the MC), the DJ, graffiti, and
      breakdancing.

      My musical journey began in the UK with a ton of Jamaican and British influence. When I came to the states at age
      11, it was at a very early stage of hip-hop (Kool Herc and the DJs were the heart of it all in the Bronx).
      Naturally when I started to organically connect with what was brewing in the hip-hop streets, for me it was King
      Tim III, Busy Busy, The Cold Crush Brothers. Those are my super heroes.

      I hear my influence via the many samples and interpolations that my fellow musicians and artists have incorporated
      in their art and body of work. It is all about how we inspire each other and create at the highest level.

      Personally for me, career milestones are never one set moment. It's about the continuous flow of being able to
      express myself through telling stories, be it on wax or streaming or even the shoes and clothes I wear or jewelry
      selection that enhance the presentation.

      A ruler is a standout individual with distinctive style and characteristics. Clear vision with a purpose.
      Confidence with character and passion.

      When we are our authentic selves, human kind will gravitate toward purity. Hip-Hop provides this runway for this
      form of expressive authenticity and beautiful noise." </p>

    <h2 class="pruducents2">Wiz Khalifa</h2>


    <p> "Both the sample era and mixtape era allowed me to get really creative to make music that shaped my sound at the
      start of my career.

      50 years of hip-hop is special because it means the culture has been pushing forward and redefining itself. It’s
      here as a staple and one of the biggest genres to date. Only going up from here." </p>
