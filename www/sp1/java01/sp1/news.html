      Beyonc√© sends a heartfelt message to her fans for making Renaissance: A Film By Beyonce number one.<br><br>
      In the message, Bey expresses how challenging making the film was. "I am so deeply thankful to AMC and every team
      member who worke
      d so hard on this film. I just can‚Äôt thank all of you enough for your support. It was one of the hardest things
      I‚Äôve
      ever done because
      of the short turnaround time. I practically slept in the edit, color, and mix sessions. The race against time
      continued in order to get
      this film out so quickly. But it was so worth all the grind. I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of love from my
      Hive. And WOW! I am so touc
      hed and encouraged by the incredible reviews!!!"<br><br>

      The statement continues, " I am so touched and encouraged by the incredible reviews!!! I love seeing everyone all
      dressed up in their most opulent lewks in the theaters. The mute challenges still happening, even in the theater!!
      Y‚Äôall are cracking me up. Please keep that energy going. I can‚Äôt wait to see what else yall do :) I also love
      seeing
      the positive take aways from people who were not my fans or didn‚Äôt yet k
      now my story. The people who had no interest in seeing my shows who have now gained a deeper understanding and
      respect for all it takes to be a RENAISSANCE woman."<br><br>

      "I‚Äôm very proud that we launched the film on World AIDS Day in memory of my Uncle Johnny. I pray I continue to
      make
      something that lifts all of y‚Äôall up the way you continue to lift me up. While I‚Äôm often critical and feel my art
      is
      never finished, the pendulum swings. I feel gratitude. ‚ÄúWe did it.‚Äù We have the #1 movie in the country! And a üíØ
      on
      Rotten Tomatoes.. And it‚Äôs because of you and your support! I humbly thank you."
