        Taylor Swift admitted that she didn't leave her home for a year after Kim Kardashian leaked her phone call with
        Kanye West back in 2016.<br><br>

        During a recent interview with Time, the Grammy Award-winning singer spoke about the time Kardashian leaked an
        edited version of Swift and Kanye's pho
        ne conversation to prove that the pop star agreed to the verse about herself in his hit song
        "Famous."<br><br>

        "You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and
        then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar," Swift said. "That took me down psychologically to a place
        I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to
        get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down
        really, really hard."<br><br>

        Elsewhere in the conversation, Swift shared her input on West's 2022 downfall following his anti-Semitic
        comments. "Nothing is permanent. So I’m very careful to be grateful every second that I get to be doing this at
        this level, because I’ve had it taken away from me before. There is one thing I’ve learned: My response to
        anything that happens, good or bad, is to keep making things. Keep making art," she told the publication. "But
        I’ve also learned there’s no point in actively trying to quote unquote defeat your enemies. Trash takes itself
        out every single time." <br><br>
