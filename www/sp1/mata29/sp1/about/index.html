                <h2>About the band</h2>
                <p>
                    Jiný Metro is a Prague-based alternative folk duo consisting of Klára Čmejrková and Katie Alžběta
                    Brown. The duo met in grammar school, where they began singing together and have been friends ever
                    since. Since the release of their first album in 2021, their repertoire has expanded by hours worth
                    of catchy and witty songs about everyday life, relationships and hypothetical situations. Sung in
                    Czech, English and French, their duets are accompanied by electric guitar, bass guitar, cello,
                    ukulele, flute, clarinet, keyboards, percussion, and toy saxophone. Since 2022, the band has been
                    performing with multi-instrumentalist Alex Matějíček.

                        The early years of Jiný Metro. Klára and Katie were classmates at school and wrote their first
                        song,
                        Vysavač, to serve as background music for an assignment. The girls continued to create music
                        together, performing around Prague and writing most of the songs that would later appear on the
                        Rande s revizorem album. In respect to their genre of music, the duo chose to use the Czech name
                        Jiný Metro, meaning "alternative underground".

                    <p>
                        During a small break between waves of COVID, the girls began to compile and record their songs
                        on an
                        album. For one of the songs, titled French Song, they created their first and only music video,
                        which was released on YouTube in December 2020. The full album was released on Spotify on June
                        4th,
                        2021, and was titled Rande s revizorem, meaning "a date with the ticket inspector". Both members
                        of
                        Jiný Metro decided to deepen their knowledge of music, with Klára enrolling in the music
                        composition
                        program at the Prague Conservatory and Katie enrolling in the flute program at the Jan Deyl
                        Conservatory.

                        In summer 2022, the band was joined by Alex Matějíček, a fellow composition student at the
                        Prague
                        Conservatory. As a trio, they performed their 100th show, and they continue to work on new
                        music. In
                        2023, the band began to play its first international shows in Leipzig, Germany and Eibenthal,
                        Romania, and is set to release an EP in early 2024.
