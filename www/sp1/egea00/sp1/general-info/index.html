                <p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> Generic congress will take place at the Prague Congress Centre (PCC) which is one
                    of the modern architectural landmarks of Prague and the largest convention and culture centre in the
                    Czech Republic.
                    <br><br>
                    The Congress Centre itself was built in the late 1970s and opened in 1981. The actual building of
                    the Congress Centre is very impressive and is a unique kind of museum with wonderful examples of
                    decorative art and design of the 1970s and 1980s. The Prague Congress Centre ranks among the
                    best-known congress venues in Europe with more than 50 halls, reception and meeting rooms with a
                    total capacity of up to 9,300 people, and 13,000 m2 of exhibition space.
                    <br><br>
                    Its location is very practical, being easily accessible from the city centre by underground or
                    motorways. The Prague Congress Centre is situated in a unique location with a beautiful panoramic
                    view of Prague with its large parks, the Vltava River and Prague Castle.</p>

                <h3>Getting around</h3>
                <p>The public transport infrastructure consists of an intensely used integrated transport system of
                    Prague Metro (its length is 59 km with 57 stations in total), Prague Tram System (including the
                    “nostalgic tram” no. 91), buses, the Petřín funicular to Petřín Hill, and six ferrets. Prague has
                    one of the highest rates of public transport usage in the world with 1.2 billion passenger journeys
                    per annum.</p>
                <div class="split-container">
                    <div class="split-content"><h3>Airport</h3>
                        <p>Václav Havel Airport Prague handles flights of most European carriers and also some overseas
                            flights. It is located 30–45 minutes by car from the centre of Prague. There is a good
                            connection between the airport and city centre by public transport buses and taxis.
                            <br><br>
                            To get to city center, please use bus line 119 and Metro A.You should buy a ticket before
                            travelling and these can be found at the arrival hall, at ticket machines or at the
                            newsagents (if arriving late and all shops are closed buy a ticket from the driver but large
                            banknotes are not accepted).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="split-image airport"></div>
                </div>
                <h3>Public transport</h3>
                <p>Prague has a very sophisticated subway, tram and bus transport system. The Prague underground is very
                    efficient. At peak times, trains run every 1-3 minutes, and during off-peak hours at least every
                    5-10 minutes.
                    <br><br>
                    You can find more information about Prague public transport on the website <a
                            href="https://www.dpp.cz/en" target="_blank">www.dpp.cz.</a>
                    <br><br>
                    Most visitors find travel passes cost-effective and hassle-free. If you use public transport more
                    than a few times a day, definitely go for one. Also, 3- and 5-day passes allow free transport for a
                    child aged between 6 and 14 (inclusive).</p>
                <h3>Prague City Transport Fares</h3>

                    tickets before boarding the vehicle or entering the Metro system. The ticket is valid only if marked
                    in the validator.</p>

                    The Congress Secretariat assists delegates by processing the official invitations upon request.
                    These letters do not commit the Local Organiser to any financial obligation.
                    <br>
                    Before your appointment, please contact the embassy and ask which of the following documents are
                    required to issue a visa for you: Official invitation by the Congress Organiser or Official
                    invitation by the Foreigners Department of the Czech Police.</p>
                <h4>Official invitation by Congress Organiser – required information:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your full name</li>
                    <li>Date of birth</li>
                    <li>Place of birth</li>
                    <li>Country of citizenship (country which issued your passport)</li>
                    <li>Passport number</li>
                    <li>Date of expiry of your passport</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Condition for the issuance of the invitation letter by the Congress Organiser is as follows:</h4>
                <p><b>Payment of registration fee</b><br><br>
                    The invitation letter should be presented to the Czech embassy in your country in order to receive a
                    Visa for the Congress.
                    The invitation letter will be sent to your email as a PDF file upon providing all the required
                    information. However, should the embassy require an original invitation letter, we can deliver it by
                    two following ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Standard post service – the fee shall be covered by the participant in advance, together with
                        the congress fee. The standard post service fee is 10 EUR.
                    </li>
                    <li>Express delivery service (FedEx, DHL) – the fee shall be covered by the participant in advance,
                        together with the congress fee. The express delivery fee is 30–60 EUR, depending on country of
                        delivery. The organiser strongly recommends using this option as it is faster and enables the
                        delivery to be tracked (using a tracking number).
