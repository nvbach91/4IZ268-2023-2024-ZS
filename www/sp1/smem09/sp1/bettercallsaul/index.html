                Better Call Saul is an American crime and legal drama television series created by Vince Gilligan and
                Peter
                Gould. It is a spin-off, as well as both a prequel and a sequel, to Gilligan's previous series, Breaking
                Bad. Set primarily in the early to middle part of the first decade of the 2000s in Albuquerque, New
                Mexico,
                the series develops Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), an earnest lawyer and former con artist, into a greedy
                criminal defense attorney known as Saul Goodman. Also shown is the moral decline of former police
                officer
                Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), who becomes a violent fixer for drug traffickers to support his
                granddaughter and her widowed mother. The show premiered on AMC on February 8, 2015. The sixth and final
                season consisting of 13 episodes premiered on April 18, 2022, and concluded on August 15, 2022, after
                six
                seasons for a total of 63 episodes.

                At the start of the series, Jimmy struggles financially while he mostly works on court-appointed cases
                as
                a public defender. His romantic interest and former colleague, Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn), is an attorney
                at Hamlin, Hamlin &amp; McGill (HHM), a law firm co-owned by Jimmy's brilliant but unwell brother, Chuck
                McGill (Michael McKean) and Chuck's law partner, Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian). After hiring Jimmy as
                legal representation, Mike provides advice and security for Nacho Varga (Michael Mando), an intelligent
                drug dealer who later becomes a mole for Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), a drug lord and legitimate
                businessman as owner of the Los Pollos Hermanos fast food establishment. Their operations are disrupted
                by members of the murderous Salamanca family, including Lalo Salamanca (Tony Dalton). Odenkirk, Banks,
                and Esposito reprise their roles from Breaking Bad, as do many others who make guest appearances.

                Better Call Saul has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its acting, characters,
                writing, direction, and cinematography; many critics have called it a worthy successor to Breaking Bad
                and one of the greatest television series of all time, with some deeming it superior to its predecessor.
                It has garnered many award nominations, including a Peabody Award, 46 Primetime Emmy Awards, 15 Writers
                Guild of America Awards, 14 Critics' Choice Television Awards, six Screen Actors Guild Awards, and four
                Golden Globe Awards. At the time of its airing, the series premiere held the record for the
                highest-rated scripted series premiere in basic cable history. Better Call Saul has its own set of
                official multimedia spin-offs and related media within Breaking Bad franchise. This includes a talk
                show, several web series and digital shorts, comic books, and an insider podcast.
