                <h2>Walter White's Drug Empire</h2>
                <p> Walter White's Drug Empire, also known simply as Walt's Drug Empire, or Heisenberg’s Empire, was a
                    massive meth manufacturing and distribution operation which started in 2008 in Albuquerque, New
                    Mexico. It was founded by former chemistry teacher Walter White, and catalyzed by his former student
                    Jesse Pinkman. Their lawyer Saul Goodman also played a pivotal role in the empire's success.

                <h2>Gustavo Fring's Drug Empire</h2>
                <p> Gustavo Fring's Drug Empire, also known simply as Gus' Drug Empire, or the Fring Drug Ring, was an
                    American drug organization based in Albuquerque, New Mexico and run by drug kingpin Gustavo Fring.
                    It was the second most powerful drug organization in United States history, being surpassed only by
                    Walter White's Drug Empire. Using a fried chicken fast-food restaurant chain Los Pollos Hermanos as
                    a cover organization, Gus' empire controlled one of the primary transportation routes for billions
                    of dollars worth of illegal crystal methamphetamine shipments annually in the Southwestern United
                    States. The meth, given the street name "blue sky" for its blue color, was manufactured by Walter
                    White and Gale Boetticher, who was later replaced by Jesse Pinkman.

                <h2>The Cartel</h2>
                <p> The Cartel, also known as the Juárez Cartel, or the Vuente Cartel, was a Mexican drug cartel active
                    in Ciudad Juárez, Michoacán, Chihuahua, and Jalisco. The Cartel controlled one of the primary
                    transportation routes for billions of dollars worth of
                    illegal drug shipments annually entering the United States from Mexico. They were a ruthless and
                    dangerous criminal empire that had been known to decapitate their rivals, mutilate their corpses,
                    and dump them in public in order to instill fear not only in the general public, but also in local
                    law enforcement and their rivals.

                <h2>The Salamancas</h2>
                <p> The Salamanca family, better known as The Salamancas, are a Mexican crime family notorious for being
                    affiliated The Cartel. Notable for being ruthless and dangerous, they live by the creed that "family
                    is all" and believe in "blood for blood". The earliest known history of the family began when
                    Abuelita's son, Hector Salamanca, became a feared and respected Capo of The Cartel, and the rival of
                    Gustavo Fring. Hector's nephew Lalo Salamanca joined his uncle as a fellow Capo and high-ranking
                    member.
