                <p>LB Services was founded in 2015. At the beginning of its existence we were mainly engaged in tuning and minor repairs at customers' premises. Gradually, however, we began to focus on other services and offering them to public institutions, conservatories and the like throughout the country. Today we provide full service and consulting services in many of them.</p>
                <p>Since 2020 we have been renovating pianos and upright pianos in our workshops and since this year we have been selling and buying musical instruments. Renovations have become our specialty over time. Today, we also restore historically valuable pianos with an emphasis on preserving their authenticity, and at a top level.</p>
                <p>We operate throughout the Czech Republic and, by agreement, outside the Czech Republic. Repairs are carried out by professional staff with many years of experience, some of them with the highest qualifications in the field.</p>
