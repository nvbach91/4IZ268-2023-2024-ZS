                <h2>300 Competitive matches - 14.11.2023</h2>
                <p>"I'm surprised; just a few weeks ago, we were celebrating two hundred league matches, and now here
                    comes another exceptional milestone. I wonder how we've managed to survive it all (laughs). As I've
                    mentioned before, I'm starting to pay more attention to these statistics as we slowly approach
                    historic numbers. I sense that a hundred European matches aren't far off, which would be a fantastic
                    achievement. But the best gift and acknowledgment for our collective work are the last two
                    victories, especially the one against AS Roma, which I immensely value. Three hundred matches on the
                    sidelines for one club, and consecutively, is a huge number that brings us immense joy. We deeply
                    appreciate the opportunity to work for such a great club like Slavia," said Jindřich Trpišovský.</p>

                <p>Jindřich Trpišovský is a manager known mostly for his success with our beloved Slavia. He
                    began his coaching career in the lower divisions of Czech football before making a name for himself
                    at Slovan Liberec. However, he gained widespread recognition during his tenure at Slavia Prague.

                    Trpišovský took charge of Slavia Prague in 2017, and under his management, the team experienced
                    significant success both domestically and in European competitions. One of his notable achievements
                    was guiding Slavia Prague to the quarterfinals of the UEFA Europa League during the 2018-2019
                    season, an impressive feat for a club from the Czech Republic.

                    His coaching style is often praised for its tactical discipline, organization, and emphasis on team
                    unity. Trpišovský's success with Slavia Prague has not only brought him personal recognition but has
                    also elevated the profile of the club on the European stage.</p>

                <h2>Slavia vs AS Rome : Pre-game interview - 8.11.2023</h2>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q: You are in a comfortable position in the table. Will the quality displayed be more important
                        than the
                        result, given the two recent defeats?</b><br><br>
                    A: "Definitely yes, we want to redeem ourselves from Sunday. We feel that the performance against
                    Plzeň
                    was poor from our emotional and fighting perspective. We were dissatisfied with ourselves and the
                    people; now we face a big team and quality. It's always about what the opponent allows. We are
                    interested in bringing back the emotions, the desire to leave everything on the field to our game.
                    That wasn't there against Plzeň; we appeal for it to appear on Thursday. It will be a match that
                    requires a comprehensive performance, discipline, and dedication. We want to show the best of us, to
                    make it a beautiful game to watch." - Jindřich Trpišovský</p>
                <p><b>Q: Did emotions show in the post-match speech in the locker room after the defeat against
                        Plzeň?</b><br><br>
                    A: "We discussed the result emphatically after the match and on Tuesday. One thing is the result; of
                    course, both teams always want to win, but as I said, we lacked emotions, determination, and the
                    desire to overturn the unfavorable result from us in the duel. Plzeň played excellently, but from
                    our side, what we are used to have in big matches was missing. It happened perhaps for the first
                    time in the six years I´ve been here. We were dissatisfied, but as I said, we need to learn from it;
                    I expect improvement on Thursday. On Thursday, we must fight for Slavia. For the sold-out stadium. I
                    know the guys feel the same way. We can´t excuse ourselves by saying that we lost emotionally
                    charged players. As coaches, we have to work on this and do things so that at least an emotional
                    mark remains behind us in case of an unfavorable result." - Jindřich Trpišovský</p>
