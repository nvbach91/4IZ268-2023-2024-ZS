                    <p>
                        I've been really into software development for the past 3 years, focusing a lot on Python. I've
                        worked
                        on different projects, both on my own and as part of a team.
                        I'm good at working with data - cleaning it up, making sense of it, and using it to find useful
                        insights. I also know how to use advanced Machine Learning methods
                        to get valuable predictions from complicated data. I'm really excited about the chance to work
                        abroad
                        and apply my skills in new places.

                <h2>1999 - 2018 Ufa, Russia</h2>
                <p>
                    Born and raised in Ufa, I spent my formative years amidst its rich cultural tapestry, deeply
                    influenced by the scenic beauty of the Ural Mountains and the Belaya River.
                    My childhood and teenage years in this vibrant city were filled with learning, growth, and the
                    formation of lifelong friendships. These 18 years in Ufa shaped my character
                    and aspirations, leaving an indelible mark on my identity as I stepped into adulthood.

                <p>Prague, the city of a hundred spires, has been both my academic and professional arena. Here, I had
                    the enriching experience of studying at two universities,
                    a journey that broadened my academic horizons and deepened my expertise. Currently, this historical
                    and culturally rich city is not just a backdrop but an integral
                    part of my professional life, as I continue to work and grow in its inspiring environment.</p>
