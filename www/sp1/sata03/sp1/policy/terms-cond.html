                WhiteShield (the 'App'), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to
                these legal terms (the 'Legal Terms') (collectively, the 'Services').
                You can contact us by email at <a

            <p class="art-read">1. OUR SERVICES<br>
                The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any
                person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to
                law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction
                or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so
                on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the
                extent local laws are applicable.<br>
                The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance
                Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA),
                etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You
                may not use the Services in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).<br><br>
