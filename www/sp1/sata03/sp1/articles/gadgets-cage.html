            <h1>Here's Why Your Gadgets Need a Faraday Cage</h1>
            <p class="art-read">In our digital age, safe use of mobile devices is a significant challenge. This piece
                explores why control measures like a Faraday cage are essential for your gadgets' security.</p>

            <h3>Smartphones: Always On, Always Connected</h3>
            <p class="art-read">Contemporary life offers us the luxury of never truly being disconnected. Smartphones,
                our constant companions, are not simply switched off with the press of a button as with older gadgets.
                Instead, these advanced devices enter a power-conserving standby mode, maintaining various active
                communication functionalities. An ostensibly "off" phone continues to interact with nearby devices,
                share its geolocation, and could even potentially be hacked remotely. For those seeking absolute
                privacy, the traditional shutdown or airplane mode might not suffice.</p>
            <h3>The Uninvited Listener</h3>
            <p class="art-read">A significant 60% of smartphone users believe their devices are eavesdropping on their
                offline conversations for commercial purposes. After discussing a specific product or service, users
                have noticed relevant ads appearing on their online platforms. Although IT corporations deny any such
                intrusion into user privacy, German researchers have conducted studies detailing a plausible mechanism
                for "ad eavesdropping." The blogosphere is rife with articles and videos explicitly demonstrating how
                phones seem to present ads based on recent conversations, adding fuel to these unsettling suspicions.
            </p>
            <h3>Ensuring the Privacy of Crucial Conversations</h3>
            <p class="art-read">Not only do smartphones and other electronics monitor users' whereabouts, but they also
                have the potential to covertly switch on microphones and cameras. This loophole can be exploited by
                ill-intentioned parties to remotely eavesdrop confidential dialogues. There are situations, such as
                during pivotal business talks or confidential attorney meetings, where any risk of phone-tapping is
                unacceptable. In these instances, the key to preserving privacy is to employ devices that physically
                thwart any remote infiltration of mobile phones.</p>
            <h3>The Monetization of Personal Data</h3>
            <p class="art-read">Personal data is a commodity. Tech giants have amassed wealth by monetizing personal
                data: our interests, frequented locations, social circles, and more. Not just corporations, but also
                cybercriminals target ordinary users. Personal data, encompassing account details, passwords, passport
                information, photos, geolocation data, etc., can be bought and sold on the dark web and weaponized
                against common users. Cybersecurity is the need of the hour in today's digital jungle.</p>
            <h3>The Productivity Paradox of Smartphones</h3>
            <p class="art-read">Workplaces grapple with the smartphone-induced productivity paradox. Employees
                reportedly spend <a href="https://blog.gitnux.com/cell-phone-distraction-at-work-statistics/"
                    target="_blank">over 5 hours weekly</a> on their phones during work hours, costing companies
                billions. Moreover, the average person checks their phone every 12 minutes, hampering sustained
                concentration on work tasks. The solution? Disconnect from the network, remove the phone from sight, and
                marvel at your newfound productivity.</p>
            <div class="citation">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Adrian Ward, an American researcher, demonstrated this in an experiment. Participants given the
                        same tasks but in different phone-proximity scenarios (phone on the table, in the pocket, or in
                        another room) performed best when the phone was out of sight and mind.</p>

            <h3>A Constant Companion: Electromagnetic Radiation</h3>
            <p class="art-read">Mobile phones emit electromagnetic waves, classified as potentially carcinogenic by the
                World Health Organization. Neither airplane mode nor "Do Not Disturb" mode fully safeguards users as the
                phone's radio modules remain active. Even manufacturers recommend keeping smartphones away from the
                head.<br><br>
                Independent research indicates that popular smartphone models often exceed the declared Specific
                Absorption Rate (SAR) standards. While we can't altogether abandon smartphones, we can strive for a
                healthier usage compromise. For instance, block your phone's radio signals when not in use and use
                special radiation-reducing bags while keeping the device connected.</p>
            <h3>In Conclusion: Striving for Privacy, Security, and Balance</h3>
            <p class="art-read">In the face of modern realities, we cannot revert to the pre-smartphone era, nor should
                we use technology recklessly. <a href="../shop.html">Velter products</a> are designed to help strike a
                balance in smartphone usage while providing a reliable means to control them. Velter's shielding
                sleeves, capsules, bags, and other devices let you manage your devices on a physical level, making them
                more effective than airplane mode, shutdowns, or other software solutions.</p>
