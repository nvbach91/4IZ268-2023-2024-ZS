                            The BWT Alpine F1 Team secured a valuable point in today's Mexico City Grand Prix, as
                            Esteban Ocon exhibited a resilient performance by recovering from the back of the grid
                            to clinch tenth place at the checkered flag. Meanwhile, Pierre Gasly engaged in a
                            race-long battle for points, ultimately concluding the race in eleventh position.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The race took a significant turn when a red flag was triggered on lap 34 due to Kevin
                            Magnussen's forceful impact, colliding with the trackside wall at Turn 8. During the red
                            flag period, Estaban opted for tyre change going from Hards to Mediums. Managing the
                            newly fitted Mediums until the race's conclusion, Esteban executed a clinical overtaking
                            maneuver on Nico Hülkenberg into Turn 1 five laps from the end, securing the final
                            point.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pierre made a strong start to move up to ninth place at the beginning of the race, pitting
                            on lap 28 for Hards, just before the Safety Car on lap 33 for Magnussen’s off, before that
                            incident was upgraded to a red flag. After clean getaways from the second standing start of
                            the day, both drivers looked to chase down the points-paying positions. Eventually, Esteban
                            overtook Hülkenberg on lap 66 into Turn 1, Pierre doing the same into Turn 12, with the pair
                            crossing the line in tenth and eleventh.

                                        “It was a tough afternoon for us today and it’s always disappointing to miss out
                                        on scoring points. I think we maximised everything that we had in our hands but,
                                        unfortunately, the timing of the Safety Car and Red Flag really cost us as we
                                        were well in the fight for at least ninth place after a good start and a decent
                                        first stint. I’m glad Kevin [Magnussen] is OK as that looked like a heavy impact
                                        for that incident. There are things we need to improve as, clearly, we were
                                        lacking in a few areas today. I’m looking forward to rounding off the triple
                                        header in Brazil next weekend. It’s a Sprint, so more points up for grabs, and
                                        it’s a place where I hold fond memories from my podium in 2019. I’m ready for it
                                        and targeting a much better performance.”

                                        “A tricky weekend has ended on a positive note with a hard-fought top ten finish
                                        here in Mexico. On the post-race radio, I said ‘never give up’ and today was
                                        about that. Well done to the team on a well-managed race where there was a lot
                                        happening from start to finish. We did not have a great start to begin, losing a
                                        few places and I found myself running last for a while. It was a tough first
                                        half of the race and we took a risk on strategy and it paid off. The race
                                        restart was mega, where I gained a few places in the first couple of corners.
                                        From then on, we raced well and maximised our potential today with a tenth-place
                                        finish and a well-deserved point.”
