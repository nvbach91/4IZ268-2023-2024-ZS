                            The BWT Alpine F1 Team delivered a noteworthy performance at the Las Vegas Grand Prix,
                            gaining a total of 12 points in a race marked by both challenges and highlights.
                            Esteban Ocon's display of skill was particularly impressive as he orchestrated a
                            remarkable climb from the sixteenth position on the starting grid to secure a
                            commendable fourth-place finish at the chequered flag.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Saturday night Grand Prix, set against the stunning backdrop of the city lights,
                            provided an engaging spectacle that unfolded with incidents in the early stages. During
                            the opening lap, Esteban Ocon demonstrated exceptional racecraft, advancing by eight
                            positions to secure the eighth spot, while Pierre Gasly adeptly maintained his starting
                            position of fourth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the race unfolded, strategic decisions played a pivotal role. Pierre entered the pits on
                            lap 17 for a set of Hard tyres, while Esteban followed suit three laps later for his
                            mandatory stop. Subsequently, the focus shifted to tire management for the remainder of the
                            race. Approximately 15 laps later, Pierre experienced tire graining, resulting in a loss of
                            positions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the later stages, Esteban ascended to the fourth position after Oscar Piastri's late pit
                            stop. However, a twist of fate occurred as George Russell, initially ahead on the road,
                            incurred a five-second penalty. Consequently, Esteban not only claimed a well-deserved
                            fourth place but also secured 12 valuable points for the team.

                                        “It’s a disappointing outcome on my side of the garage to go from fourth on the
                                        grid to outside of the points in eleventh place. There are many things for us to
                                        review as that is not what we set out to achieve today. It was a good start
                                        under tricky conditions, the first stint was fairly well managed and we were
                                        comfortably in that top four mix. As soon as we put the Hard tyre on, we just
                                        seemed to struggle, the tyres grained and the whole second stint was a challenge
                                        just to get to the end. It was a frustrating night and it’s a pity for us. That
                                        said, it’s been a very good weekend for the team with fourth place in Qualifying
                                        and then Esteban’s fourth place in the Race. We will do our analysis and come
                                        back next weekend for the season finale in Abu Dhabi ready to end the season as
                                        best as we can.”

                                        “What a night in Las Vegas to be outside of the points to finishing in fourth
                                        place! I would like to say a massive congratulations to the team for this great
                                        result and amazing recovery. It was a chaotic start and we managed to keep it
                                        clean and gain eight positions on lap one. After that, we had to be patient,
                                        execute a clean race and managing the tyres was really the key. I made some good
                                        overtakes along the way and to finish fourth at this amazing venue is really a
                                        great result, especially considering how I was left feeling after Qualifying.
                                        There is one more race to go in Abu Dhabi next week and we will aim to carry
                                        this momentum into the season finale”
