                            The BWT Alpine F1 Team secured a commendable seven points in today's São Paulo Grand
                            Prix, showcasing a resilient performance at Interlagos. Pierre Gasly exhibited
                            remarkable skill, navigating from fifteenth on the starting grid to an impressive
                            seventh-place finish at the checkered flag. Simultaneously, Esteban Ocon executed a
                            strong Sunday effort, progressing from fourteenth on the grid to secure the tenth
                            position.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The race dynamics took a dramatic turn with a multi-car incident on the opening lap,
                            prompting a red flag. Both Esteban and Pierre demonstrated adept reactions, skillfully
                            navigating through the chaos to gain several positions. Upon the restart, Pierre
                            continued his ascent, gaining two more places to secure the ninth position, while
                            Esteban maintained a solid performance, advancing to tenth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the 71-lap race, strategic decisions played a pivotal role for our team. Esteban
                            executed a three-stop strategy (Soft-Medium-Soft-Soft), while Pierre followed a two-stop
                            plan (Soft-Medium-Soft), with both drivers concluding the race on fresh Soft tires. On lap
                            49, Pierre capitalized on a tyre advantage over Esteban, who allowed him to pass in pursuit
                            of Lewis Hamilton. Demonstrating impressive pace and securing the Fastest Lap of the race at
                            the time, Pierre skillfully closed the gap on the seven-time world champion. A well-executed
                            maneuver into Turn 1 elevated Pierre to eighth place, ultimately securing seventh position
                            after all cars completed their pit stops.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Esteban made his final pit stop a few laps later, with the objective of
                            narrowing the gap to George Russell's Mercedes for the last available point. Russell retired
                            on lap 59, facilitating Esteban's smooth journey to a tenth-place finish.

                                        “I’m very happy with today’s race and I would say it was one of our best
                                        performances of the season. It was a very challenging race to manage with
                                        multiple stints and pit-stops, but the entire team did a great job today to make
                                        the right calls and execute the stops well. For the team, in seventh and tenth,
                                        it’s clearly a strong performance, especially after starting from near the back
                                        of the grid. We competed with Carlos [Sainz] and the two Mercedes throughout, so
                                        that is clearly a good step forwards from yesterday. Next up is Las Vegas, which
                                        will no doubt be a cool experience. I’m excited for it, as I always am for new
                                        races, and it is up to us to enter that race as prepared as possible and give it
                                        our all on-track.”

                                        “Today we had a small reward with one point after a challenging race. We had a
                                        great start, gaining some positions while also avoiding the chaos in front.
                                        Unfortunately, we saw very quickly that we had very high degradation throughout
                                        and had to go for a three-stop race. We had planned for this as we saw some
                                        signs yesterday that this could be a factor, so that is something we will assess
                                        going forward. Nevertheless, a good day in the office for the team with both
                                        cars in the points and a good step since yesterday’s performance in the Sprint
                                        Race. Our focus now shifts to Las Vegas, the penultimate race of the season,
                                        which promises to be a spectacular experience where we hope to deliver another
                                        strong result.”
