                            The BWT Alpine F1 Team secured four points during the United States Grand Prix today,
                            courtesy of Pierre Gasly's commendable eighth-place finish at the Circuit of the
                            Americas in Austin, Texas. Unfortunately, Esteban Ocon was forced to retire from the
                            race on the seventh lap following substantial damage incurred during an incident on the
                            opening lap, impacting his A523 significantly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a strong start off the line, Ocon gained multiple positions up the hill into Turn
                            1. Regrettably, on the descent toward Turn 2, he became entangled in a racing incident
                            with Oscar Piastri.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pierre Gasly, despite initially dropping to tenth, by the conclusion of the opening lap,
                            ascended to eighth, capitalizing on the retirements of both Esteban Ocon and Oscar
                            Piastri.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After two pit-stops, Pierre had to keep his cool to fend off the hard charging Aston Martins
                            in the closing stages, finishing eighth place at the chequered flag to add to his two points
                            from Saturday’s Sprint. Next up for the team is the Mexico City Grand Prix where Reserve
                            Driver Jack Doohan will take over driving duties in Car #10 in Free Practice 1.

                                        “I’m feeling very pleased with today’s result and, I must say, it’s probably
                                        been our most complete weekend of the season so far with two strong Qualifying
                                        results and points from both races. We fell back a couple of positions at the
                                        start today, but I knew the pace of the car was good and we were able to keep it
                                        clean and fight our way forwards. Of course, we want to be fighting close to the
                                        front but this weekend has definitely been better for us where we have been able
                                        to extract the maximum from it. Operationally it was smooth and that’s very
                                        satisfying for all of us at the team. Now our focus is on Mexico City and
                                        delivering another solid weekend.”
                                        Bruno Famin, Interim Team Principal: “Overall it’s been a mixed Sunday for the
                                        team with Pierre in the points and Esteban unfortunately retiring from the race
                                        and therefore unable to show his potential. The car has been competitive –
                                        enough to compete for points on both days – so it is frustrating not to have
                                        both drivers in the fight for the top ten today. Esteban made a good start off
                                        the line and Pierre drove a strong race to finish in eighth and claim deserved
                                        points. This race marks the first of the triple header, we are already looking
                                        forward to Mexico City where we aim to continue our points-scoring run and
                                        having Jack [Doohan] in the car during Free Practice 1.”

                                        “It’s been a very unfortunate Sunday for us today in Austin. It feels like
                                        there’s been quite a few of those this year, which has really cost us. It’s a
                                        pity as we had a good starting position for today’s race and once again made up
                                        a few places with a strong launch and good opening corner. Unfortunately, there
                                        was then contact with Oscar [Piastri] and the damage to our floor was too severe
                                        to continue. There are some positives to take from our weekend and a lot to
                                        review as well. Mexico City is just around the corner and I know we will bounce
                                        back as a team.”
