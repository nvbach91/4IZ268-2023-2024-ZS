                            The flying Frenchman was called up to make his 2017 debut in Malaysia in place of Daniil
                            Kvyat
                            and, after proving his mettle, he was named a Toro Rosso driver the following year. A
                            further 21
                            races into his fledgling career, Gasly was moved up again – this time to replace Red Bull
                            big
                            gun Daniel Ricciardo. Gasly seemed to have a knack of being in the right place at the right
                            time
                            – a quality that’s equally handy on track. A series of impressive 2018 performances for Toro
                            Rosso – including a brilliant fourth place in Bahrain – showed exciting promise for what he
                            might do with the ‘A’ team in 2019. Unfortunately that promise only appeared in flashes –
                            and he
                            quickly suffered from unfavourable comparisons with superstar team mate Max Verstappen. So
                            much
                            so that after the summer break, he was sent back to Toro Rosso, with another young
                            up-and-comer
                            – Alex Albon – being given a shot in the ‘senior’ Red Bull seat. But Gasly bounced back, as
                            only
                            Gasly can. In the season’s remaining nine races he scored almost as any points as team mate
                            Kvyat managed over the entire year – and secured his best-ever race result with P2 in
                            Brazil.
                            That trajectory continued in 2020, peaking with an emotional maiden win at the renamed
                            AlphaTauri team’s home race in Italy, and didn’t let up in 2021 when he was back on the
                            podium
                            and scored 110 of the squad’s 142 points. When AlphaTauri’s momentum stalled in 2022, Gasly
                            decided it was time for a change – in the form of French team Alpine, with fellow Frenchman
                            –
                            and old adversary – Esteban Ocon as team mate.

                        <p>
                            Back when he was just a promising karter, Ocon’s parents sold their house, put their jobs on
                            hold, and began a life on the road, living in a caravan and travelling from circuit to
                            circuit to support their son’s burgeoning career. Sacrifice, see – but it worked. 2014 saw
                            Ocon break through in the world of single-seaters, as he beat a certain Max Verstappen to
                            the European F3 title. Backed by Mercedes, he won the GP3 title the following year and was
                            halfway through a season of DTM in 2016 when he was offered the chance to replace Rio
                            Haryanto at the minnow Manor team from the Belgian Grand Prix onwards. That opportunity led
                            to a full-time seat the following year with Force India, where his wheel-to-wheel duels with
                            highly-rated team mate Sergio Perez quickly marked him out as a rising star. But when
                            Lawrence Stroll, father of racer Lance, stepped in midway through 2018 to secure the squad’s
                            financial future, the writing was on the wall for Ocon, who was moved aside at the end of
                            the year to allow Stroll Jnr to join from Williams. Ocon bided his time, though, and after a
                            year on the sidelines as Mercedes’ reserve driver, he found his way back into a race seat
                            for 2020 with Renault, who became Alpine for 2021 – when his wait finally paid off, as he
                            scored his – and the famous French marque’s – first F1 win. Nothing in Ocon’s motorsport
                            career has come easy – but if Ocon has managed to return to the F1 grid and step atop the
                            podium, it’s through a combination of self-belief, determination and a talent that’s up
                            there with the very best.
