                            The team boasts a rich heritage, debuting in Formula One in 1981 under the name Toleman,
                            headquartered in Witney, England. In 1986, following its acquisition by Benetton Group, the
                            team underwent a name change to Benetton and clinched the 1995 Constructors' Championship.
                            By the 2000 season, Renault had acquired the team for the first time, leading to a name
                            change to Renault F1 Team in 2002. The team secured Constructors' Championships in 2005 and
                            2006, with Fernando Alonso winning the Drivers' Championships in the same years.
                            In September 2020, Renault Group communicated their plan to adopt the name "Alpine" for
                            the factory team in order to promote the Alpine brand. Consequently, the team is poised
                            to be recognized as the "Alpine F1 Team," marking the retirement of the "Renault F1 Team"
                            name after a five-year tenure.

                            Toleman marked the inception of Alpine in Formula One in 1981, participating in 70
                            Grands
                            Prix without securing a championship. Despite limited success, the team holds historical
                            significance for launching Ayrton Senna's F1 career in 1984, where he secured three
                            podium
                            finishes, including a memorable second place in Monaco. In May 1985, Toleman rebranded
                            as
                            Benetton Formula after securing major sponsorship from Benetton.

                            Benetton's journey began with the B186 powered by a BMW engine in 1986, designed by Rory
                            Byrne. A pivotal shift occurred in 1987 when the team signed a long-term deal with Ford,
                            welcoming notable drivers. Under Flavio Briatore's leadership, featuring three-time World
                            Champion Nelson Piquet, Benetton finished third in the Constructors' Championship in 1990.
                            The arrival of Michael Schumacher in 1991 brought hope for a championship, realized in 1994
                            amid intense battles and controversies, including Ayrton Senna's tragic death. In 1995,
                            Schumacher secured another title for Benetton with a Renault engine, and Johnny Herbert's
                            contributions led to the team's first and only Constructors' Championship. The subsequent
                            years brought challenges, with Ferrari's interest, key personnel departures, and Renault
                            taking over the team in 2000, fully rebranding it as the Renault F1 Team in 2002.

                            Renault, evolving from the Toleman and Benetton legacy, embarked on a quest for
                            championships. Jenson Button started the journey in 2003, giving way to Fernando Alonso in
                            2004. Against Ferrari and McLaren dominance, Renault secured back-to-back championships in
                            2005 and 2006. Fernando Alonso, in 2005, became the youngest-ever F1 World Champion,
                            claiming 15 podiums and seven wins. In 2006, Alonso and Renault triumphed again in Brazil,
                            clinching another title. Despite challenges, including race-fixing allegations in 2009,
                            Renault underwent changes, with most of the team acquired by Genii Capital, leading to the
                            arrival of Lotus in 2011.

                            Lotus Renault GP, born from Lotus Group's investment in Renault, clashed with Team Lotus led
                            by Tony Fernandes. Legal battles ensued, exacerbated by both teams utilizing Renault power
                            units. Complications arose, with Robert Kubica's near-fatal crash prompting his withdrawal.
                            In the following year, Lotus transitioned to Lotus F1 Team, while Fernandes acquired
                            Caterham. Struggling with Renault engines, Lotus turned to Mercedes for a new power unit in
                            2015. Meanwhile, Renault, not fully ready for the hybrid era, branched out to create a new
                            Formula One team.

                            In 2015, Renault revealed plans to take over Lotus F1 Team, transitioning to Renault Sport
                            Formula One Team in 2016. Red Bull Racing became an engine customer until 2018, with
                            controversies surrounding the Renault engine's performance. Red Bull switched to Honda in
                            2019, and Renault faced challenges, losing McLaren as a customer to Mercedes. Despite
                            limited success, Daniel Ricciardo secured a podium at the 2020 Eifel Grand Prix. In
                            September 2020, Renault announced a rebrand, racing as Alpine F1 Team in 2021.

                            In 2021, Alpine, formerly Renault, made a significant comeback in F1, rebranding and
                            bringing back star driver Fernando Alonso. Despite ups and downs, the French team competes
                            well in the midfield, with Alonso and teammate Esteban Ocon challenging top drivers. Alpine
                            achieved a historic win at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix, securing their first-ever victory
                            with Ocon. This marked the first win for a French driver in a French car since Alain Prost
                            in 1983. Alonso also shone on the podium, finishing third in the inaugural Qatar Grand Prix
                            in 2021.
