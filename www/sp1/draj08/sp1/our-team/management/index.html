                            Julian joined the team during the 2022 season when he became Alpine Academy Director,
                            overseeing the team’s young driver programme as well as identifying opportunities for young

                        <p>
                            His involvement in motorsport began at a young age, inspired by his father Andy Rouse’s
                            career in the British Touring Car Championship. Julian started working at Fortec Motorsport
                            in 2001 during a dominant era for the team becoming a race engineer and later Team Manager
                            on a number of different programmes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2009, Julian joined Arden Motorsport, which was owned by Christian Horner, as Team
                            Manager and Race Engineer, setting up their GP3 program, which later went on to win the

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He was then promoted into the role of Sporting Director as the company expanded and
                            eventually became General Manager overseeing all of Arden’s race activities across GP2, GP3,
                            World Series by Renault and Formula 4 categories. Julian was then tasked by Arden to set up
                            the R Motorsport GT program where he took on the role of Sporting and Performance Director
                            with huge success in Blancpain GT World Challenge and events like the Bathurst 12 hours. He
                            also spent one year as Chief Engineer for one of the R Motorsport DTM teams in 2019 looking
                            after Ferdinand Habsburg and Daniel Juncadella.
