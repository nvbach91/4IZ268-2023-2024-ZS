                </div>
                <p class="article-text">
                    Edward Christopher Sheeran was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England on 17 February 1991.
                    His early childhood home was on Birchcliffe Road in nearby Hebden Bridge. His father was a
                    curator at Cartwright Hall in Bradford, and his mother worked at Manchester City Art Gallery. In
                    December 1995, he moved with his family from Hebden Bridge to Framlingham in Suffolk, where
                    he attended the independent Brandeston Hall preparatory school (now Framlingham College Prep
                    School), then Thomas Mills High School, also in Framlingham. He has an older
                    brother named Matthew, who works as a composer. Sheeran's parents, John and Imogen, are from
                    London. His father is Irish, and Sheeran has stated that his father is from a "very
                    large" Catholic family. John is an art curator and lecturer, and Imogen is a culture publicist
                    turned jewellery designer. His parents ran Sheeran Lock, an independent art consultancy,
                    from 1990 to 2010.<br><br>

                    Sheeran sang at a local church choir at the age of four, learned how to play the guitar at age
                    eleven, and began writing songs while at Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham. He
                    also played the cello when he was younger. A 2004 school report described him as a "natural
                    performer", and his classmates also voted him "most likely to be famous". He was accepted at the
                    National Youth Theatre in London as a teenager. He successfully auditioned for Youth Music
                    Theatre UK in 2007 and joined their production of Frankenstein - A New Musical in Plymouth. He
                    is a patron of Youth Music Theatre UK (now renamed British Youth Music Theatre) and of Access to
                    Music, where he studied Artist Development. Sheeran is a second cousin of Northern Irish
                    broadcaster Gordon Burns, who hosted the British game show The Krypton Factor.

                    Sheeran has sold more than 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling
                    music artists. He has 101 million RIAA-certified units in the US, and two of his albums are in

                <p class="article-text">
                    In early 2011, after securing recording and publishing deals, Sheeran purchased and renovated a farm
                    near Framlingham, Suffolk, where he was raised. He has stated that he hopes to raise a family
                    there. During 2013, he lived between Hendersonville, Tennessee and Los Angeles,
                    California. In 2014, he bought a house in South London.<br><br>

                    Sheeran was in a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt (who was in his music
                    video for "Drunk") in 2012, before breaking up. Nesbitt is the subject of Sheeran's songs
                    "Nina" and "Photograph", while most of Nesbitt's album, Peroxide, is about Sheeran. In 2014,
                    Sheeran was in a relationship with Athina Andrelos, who works for chef Jamie Oliver. She is the

                    (original and re-recorded versions) and Reputation, as well as on a remix of the song "The Joker and
                    the Queen" from Sheeran's album =.<br><br>

                    In July 2015, Sheeran began a relationship with childhood friend and former secondary school
                    classmate Cherry Seaborn. They announced their engagement in January 2018 and were married a
                    year later. She is the inspiration of the song "Perfect". It was reported on 12
                    August 2020 that the couple were expecting their first child. On 1 September, Sheeran
                    announced on Instagram that Seaborn had given birth to a baby girl the previous week. On 19 May
                    2022, it was announced that the couple's second child, a girl, was born.<br><br>

                    Sheeran is a supporter of his local football club Ipswich Town, and his +–=÷x Tour kit
                    sponsored their 2021–22 season. Additionally, Sheeran was named in the club's squad list and
                    given the squad number of 17. His +–=÷x Tour kit sponsorship deal with Ipswich Town was renewed
                    for the 2022–23 season. A collector of Panini's FIFA World Cup sticker album, he completed the
                    2014 World Cup album. Appearing as a guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on 7 May 2017,
                    Sheeran chose His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman as his book of choice, and a lifetime supply of
                    ketchup as the one inanimate luxury item that he would take with him on a desert island.<br><br>

                    In June 2015, Forbes listed his earnings at $57 million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him
                    the 27th-highest-earning celebrity in the world. In July 2018, Forbes named Sheeran ninth on
                    their list of the highest-paid celebrities. According to The Sunday Times Rich List of 2019,
                    Sheeran is worth £160 million (US$207 million) as the 17th-richest musician in the UK.
                    Sheeran's net worth is estimated at £200 million in 2020.<br><br>

                    On 24 October 2021, Sheeran tested positive for COVID-19 less than a week before the release of his
                    fifth album. On 1 March 2023, he revealed that his wife, while pregnant, had developed a tumour
                    with "no route to treatment until after the birth".
