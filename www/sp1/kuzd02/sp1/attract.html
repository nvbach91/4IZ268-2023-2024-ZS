        <h3>1. Thingvellir National Park</h3>
        <p>Thingvellir National Park is one of Iceland’s most beautiful destinations and the first stop on the “Golden Circle”. The park, which is located about 40 km (25 miles) northeast of Iceland’s capital, Reykjavík, is a site of historical, cultural, and geological significance.</p>
        <img class="img" src="./assets/img/attr2.jpeg" alt="Attractive Place 1">
        <p>It is about 240 km2 in size and its protection is based on the Þingvellir Conservation Act dating back to 1928. The national park was enlarged and the conservation status improved through better conservation and management with new legislation in 2004 by Act no. 47/2004 on Þingvellir National Park and by regulation no. 848/2005 on Þingvellir National Park.</p>
        <p>Thingvellir National Park represents unity, freedom, and independence. From the beginning of its known history, it was the site of major cultural changes and decisions, from young to old. People of all different sectors and economic standings came together when they would never have crossed paths before.</p>
        <img class="img" src="./assets/img/attr1.jpeg" alt="Attractive Place 1">

        <h3>2. Gullfoss waterfall</h3>
        <p>Gullfoss (translated to ‘Golden Falls’) is one of Iceland’s most iconic and beloved waterfalls, found in the Hvítá river canyon in Southwest Iceland.</p>
        <p>For those who rent a car or take a Golden Circle tour, Gullfoss waterfall can be reached within two hours from Iceland's capital. Most of the guided packages around the country include a stop at Gullfoss, such as this popular 6-Day Vacation, as do almost all self-drive journeys, like this 7-Day Winter Road Trip.</p>
        <img class="img" src="./assets/img/attr5.jpeg" alt="Attractive Place 2">
        <p>The water in Hvítá river travels from the glacier Langjökull, before cascading 32 meters (105 feet) down Gullfoss’ two stages in a dramatic display of nature’s raw power. This incredible site is seen by most visitors, as it is on the Golden Circle sightseeing route.</p>
        <p>Because of the waterfall’s two stages, Gullfoss should actually be thought of as two separate features. The first, shorter cascade is 11 meters tall (36 feet), whilst the second drop is 21 meters (69 feet). The canyon walls on both sides of the waterfall reach heights of up to 70 meters (230 feet), descending into the great Gullfossgjúfur canyon. Geologists believe that this canyon was formed by glacial outbursts at the beginning of the last age.
            In the summer, approximately 140 cubic meters (459 cubic feet) of water surges down the waterfall every second, whilst in winter that number drops to around 109 cubic meters (358 cubic feet). With such energy, visitors should not be surprised to find themselves drenched by the waterfall’s mighty spray should they get too close.</p>
        <img class="img" src="./assets/img/attr4.jpeg" alt="Attractive Place 2">
        <p>As mentioned, Gullfoss makes up a part of the highly popular Golden Circle sightseeing route, alongside the Geysir geothermal area and Þingvellir National Park. Many Golden Circle tours include additional activities that can be taken from Gullfoss, such as ascending the mighty nearby glacier Langjökull and entering its ice tunnels or snowmobiling along its gleaming surface.</p>
        <h3>Restaurant / Cafe</h3>
        <p>Besides Gullfoss, visitors can enjoy the views from Gullfoss Cafe, a locally run delicatessen that serves a wide variety of refreshments and meals. The menu has options to tantalize everyone’s taste buds: hot soups, sandwiches, salads, and cakes. There is also a shop on site where visitors can browse and purchase traditional Icelandic souvenirs.</p>

        <h3>3. Blue Lagoon</h3>
        <p>Relax and rejuvenate at the world-famous geothermal spa, the Blue Lagoon.</p>
        <p>The Blue Lagoon started as a pool of wastewater from the Svartsengi geothermal plant in 1976. The first person to bathe there was Valur Margeirsson in 1981. He was met with some resistance prior to taking the first dip as people thought he was mad for wanting to bath in a "blue mud pool". He and others soon began to notice the unusual but remarkable healing qualities of the azure waters.
            Those with conditions such as psoriasis found the waters immediately soothing for their condition. News quickly spread, and by 1987, the first swimming facilities were officially opened.  
            Since then, the establishment has only grown, from an open pool with no surrounding buildings to a luxurious spa, research center and a pair of hotels.</p>

        <h3>4. The Original Hot Spring Geyser</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Location: Geysir is located in the Haukadalur Valley in southwestern Iceland.</li>
            <li>History: Geysir is one of the oldest known geysers in the world and has been active for approximately 10,000 years. It gave its name to the term "geyser" used for all similar phenomena.</li>
            <li>Activity: While Geysir itself is not as consistently active as it once was, its neighbor, Strokkur, is a highly active geyser that erupts approximately every 5-10 minutes, shooting boiling water up to 30 meters into the air.</li>
            <li>Strokkur: Strokkur is often considered the star of the area and is situated a short distance from Geysir. It's known for its reliable and frequent eruptions, making it a popular attraction for visitors.</li>
            <li>Hot Springs: Besides the geysers, the Haukadalur Valley is home to numerous hot springs, mud pots, and fumaroles, creating a geothermal wonderland.</li>
            <li>Caution: Visitors are advised to exercise caution and stay on marked paths, as the geothermal features are surrounded by boiling hot water and mud.</li>
            <li>Tourist Attraction: Geysir and the surrounding geothermal area are significant tourist attractions and are often included in the popular Golden Circle route, a must-visit for those exploring Iceland's natural wonders.</li>
        </ul>
        <img class="img" src="./assets/img/HotSpring.jpeg" alt="The Original Hot Spring Geyser">
        <p>Remember that the activity of geysers can vary, and while Strokkur is reliable, Geysir itself may not erupt as frequently. Always adhere to safety guidelines and enjoy the remarkable geothermal features responsibly.</p>

        <h3>5. Reykjavik</h3>
        <p>Reykjavik: Capital of Iceland</p>
        <p>Reykjavík is the natural starting point for any visit to Iceland, and not undeservedly so. The capital is world-renowned for its culture, history, and natural beauty on all fronts.</p>
        <img class="img" src="./assets/img/Reykjavik.jpg" alt="Reykjavik">
        <p>Downtown Reykjavík is Iceland's nucleus of Iceland's culture and arts scene. By day, the café culture rules supreme, with the lively hum of conversations. As evening arrives, people start filling into the city's excellent restaurants, where local ingredients are served with fresh delicious lamb, seafood or wild game.</p>
        <p>Reykjavík is a city of bold contrasts: it is both cosmopolitan and small-town; vibrant and sophisticated; young-at-heart and yet full of history. Many monuments, new and old, are also worth a peek, including the newly built oceanfront music and conference centre,  Harpa. Luckily, everything in Reykjavík is close by, museums, galleries, theatres, cafés and swimming pools for example. As such, the city is perhaps best explored by foot or bike.</p>
