                            <h3>French revolution</h3>
                            <p>French revolution (sometimes called "The Great French Revolution" or "The Revolution of 1789") took place between the years 1789 and 1799 and marked the end of the rule of the Bourbon monarchy. The revolution began with the convening of the Estates-General in 1789, where representatives from the clergy, nobility, and common people (the Third Estate) sought to address fiscal issues and social injustice. Tensions, the gathering of troops around Paris and dismissal of any notion of reforms by the monarchy led to the storming of Bastille on July 14, 1789.</p>
                            <p>Though the revolution began with noble goals of democratic values and achieving liberity, equality and fraternity, it devolved into series of power strugles, persecution and violence. Of particular note is period of extreme political violence from 1793 to 1794. Perpetrated by Jacobins led by Maximilien Robespierre, public executions became frequent during this time.</p>
                            <p>The revolution also faced external threats, with France at war against European monarchies, who saw the new french state as a threat to the existing order. During these campaign, one Napoleon Bonaparte distinguished himself as a military leader. In 1799, Napoleon staged a coup, establishing himself as First Consul and later as Emperor, bringing an end to the radical phase of the revolution.</p>

                            <h3>Napoleons beginings</h3>
                            <p>Napoleon was born on Corsica into a family of lower nobility of italian descent. At the age of 9 he traveled to France, where he got his military education at the Royal Military School in Brienne via a scholarship. He spent 9 years here, during which he has shown great aptitude for mathematics and keen interest in history, particularly military history.</p>
                            <p>His first military posting after graduating in september of 1785 was as a second lieutenant in a artillery regiment. After the breakout of the french revolution, Napoleon quickly embraced its ideals, seeing it as an opportunity for accelerating his carrer. In 1792, he was appointed as a captain and distinguished himself in the Siege of Toulon, where he played a crucial role in the capture of the city from royalist forces. His success in Toulon caught the attention of political leaders, including Paul Barras, who became a key figure in Napoleon's future ascent. As an artillery officer, he was instrumental in the capture of Fort Toulon in 1793, for which he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In 1795 he successfully suppressed a royalist uprising in the streets of Paris and became a divisional general. The following year he was sent by the Directory to war with Austria and given command of the French army in Italy. Here he seized the opportunity offered to him, and by a series of victories forced Austria to sue for peace.</p>
                            <p> In 1799, he orchestrated a coup d'état, overthrowing the Directory and establishing the Consulate. In the aftermath, he emerged as the First Consul, consolidating power and effectively becoming the de facto ruler of France.<p>

                        <h2>Napoleon made emperor</h2>
                        <p>After orchestrating the coup of 18 Brumaire in 1799, Napoleon became the First Consul of France, effectively seizing control of the government. His leadership during this period was marked by a series of reforms aimed at stabilizing and strengthening France both domestically and internationally. Internally, Napoleon implemented the Constitution of the Year VIII, establishing the Consulate as the new form of government. He also initiated the Napoleonic Code, a comprehensive legal system that streamlined and modernized French law. These reforms aimed to provide a stable foundation for the nation, reconciling the revolutionary ideals with the need for order. </p>
                        <p>Napoleon's foreign policy during the Consulate was characterized by diplomatic and military successes. The Treaty of Amiens in 1802 briefly brought peace between France and Britain, allowing Napoleon to focus on internal affairs. However, tensions soon resurfaced, leading to the resumption of hostilities.</p>
                        <p>In 1804, against a backdrop of domestic stability and growing political support, Napoleon took a significant step by declaring himself Emperor of the French. This move signaled a break from the revolutionary principles of equality and republicanism, but it also symbolized the establishment of a strong, centralized government under his leadership. Napoleon's coronation took place on December 2, 1804, at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. He crowned himself Emperor, emphasizing his independence from traditional monarchies. The Pope, Pius VII, attended the ceremony to consecrate the imperial dignity, but Napoleon took the crown from the Pope's hands and crowned himself—a symbolic act that underscored his authority.</p>

                        <h2>Prelude</h2>
                        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Charles_Th%C3%A9venin_-_Reddition_de_la_ville_d%27Ulm.jpg/640px-Charles_Th%C3%A9venin_-_Reddition_de_la_ville_d%27Ulm.jpg" alt="Macks army surrenders at Ulm">
                        <p>Initially, napoleon planned the conquest of Great Britain, with which France was at war since 1803. Troops were trained and concentrated in the coastal areas around La-Manche. Furthemore, France annexed Hannover on 5th of june 1803, annexed the Ligurian Republic in the same year and after making himself the emperor he also accepted the italian crown on the 26th of may 1805. Concerned about his expanding influence and territorial gains, Austria, Russia, and other European powers joined forces to challenge the new French empire. Thus, the war of the third coalition has begun</p>
                        <p>Not wanting to get bogged down in a defensive war against enemies on multiple fronts, Napoleon decided to go on the offensive. His plan was to quickly defeat Austria and knock them out of the war and then face the Russians. His army, initially kept for invasion of Great Britain, was now 200000 men strong and renamed to Grande Armée and was under his command moving in the direction of the heartland of the Austrian empire.</p>
                        <p>French army was able to take the enemy by suprise, mainly due to it's speed and organization. French used the core systems, in which the army is divided into smaller cores. These cores had their own artilery, cavalry and other specialist detachments, which allowed them to move and fight more independently. Thus, they could advance along multiple roads, increasing their overall mobility.</p>
                        <p>Austrians were taken by complete suprise. On the 7th of october 1805 french cores of marshals Soult, Davout and cavarly units under comand of Lannes and Murat reached Danube in the rear of Austrian army of lieutenant field marshal Mack near Ulm. The Austrian army was encircled few days later and under failed attempts of breaking out, the entire army capitulated on the 20th of October. Russian army of general Kutuzov was not near enough to relieve the Austrians and had to, for now, retreat. During the campaign, french forces next captured the city of Viena and pursued allied forces into Bohemia, where they took Brno without a fight.</p>
                        <p>However, with winter aproaching and french supply lines at a danger of being stretched too thin, Napoleon needed to force the enemy armies into a decisive battle. For this purpose, Napoleon gave an impresion of his army being in way weaker position than it really was, through letters and requests for peace negotiations. It worked, and both sides would soon meet for battle near Brno, at Austerlitz (Slavkov).</p>

                            <h3>Positioning and numbers</h3> 
                            <p>The battle was to be fought between armies of roughly equal size. French army had about 58000 foot soldiers, 11500 cavalrymen and 157 cannons. Oposite of them was the coalition of Austrian and Russian armies. Russian army consisted of about 50000 foot soldiers, 14000 cavalrymen and 318 cannons. Austrians brought estimated 11000 foot soldiers, 3000 cavalrymen and 70 cannons. The battle is often called "The Battle of Three Emperors", since Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor Francis I. of Austria and Tzar Alexander I. of Russia were all present.</p>
                            <p>The plan of the Allies, who had only a very vague idea of the French forces and their deployment, was to cut off Napoleon's forces at Brno from Vienna, the French forces there and the main line of communication of the French army. They would therefore direct their blow against the French right flank, which they would attempt to outflank. Originally, however, they had intended a bypass from the north and had organized their army accordingly. The confusion which the change of arrangement will cause will be one of the chief causes of their failure. Napoleon had a very similiar plan. He intended to draw the enemy army against his center, swing the front of his army against the south and fall upon the allied right flank and push them against french reinforcements called up from Vienna.</p>

                            <h3>Allied attack</h3> 
                            <p>Napoleon could have simply retained the excelent defensive position on Pratzen heights in order to stop the allied advance. However, his goal was a total defeat of the enemy army and so he lured them in, giving up these hills. The bait was taken and Pratzen heights were occupied by allies. In order to fight the french, they would have to descent into the valley on the French right-flank.</p>
                            <p>The enemy did esentially what Napoloen expected, although their attack was focused even further south, at villages of Telnitz and Sokolnitz. Fightingbegan at night, with vanguard units under Kienmayer trying to take Telnitz. Around 7am, russian soldiers began descending the heights to reinforce the attack. Due to initial expectations of allied attack being further north, Davout was ordered by Napoleon to take positions at Turan. Davout quickly gained an overview of the situation and on his own initiative decided to support Legrand between Telnice and Sokolnice. Fierce fighting would continue around the area, but French line would hold.</p>
                            <p>Napoleon took advantage of the situation when more than half of the Russo-Austrian army was occupied by the battle between Telnitz and Sokolnitz. He ordered the intended left flank manoeuvre to bring the French army across the Pratzen heights to the right flank of the three Russian columns, which would decide the outcome of the battle. The three marshals led their troops forward, the main mass being made up of Soult's corps. However, the plan was complicated by confusion and unexpected encounters with Bagration and the Allied cavalry. The fighting on the Pratec Heights was the fiercest in the entire battle, but in the end the French were able to overwhelm the Austrians and Russians in a surprising manner.</p>

                            <h3>Final blow</h3> 
                            <p>With the Pratzen heights secured, it was time for the final part of the plan. The allied army was now, effectively, split into two with large concentration of its forces locked in heavy fighting around Sokolnitz and Telnitz.</p>
                            <p>Marshal Soult attacked the allied left flank, supported by the reserves, and pushed them towards the southwest. Davout joined the attack, which meant that the Russians were attacked from two sides. Przybyszewski's column was almost surrounded, and the other two columns were also looking for retreat routes. The rest of the Allied forces were pinned down by the ponds, and the Pratzen heights were causing them to come under artillery attack. Although legend speaks of broken ice and thousands drowned, this information is considered propaganda. For the Allies, the outcome of the battle was disastrous.</p>     
                            <p>Overall, French army suffered 1500 dead and 7000 wounded. On the Austro-Russian side, 15000 soldiers were killed or wounded. About 30000 more were taken prisoner. Remains of the Russian army retreat towards the Russian frontier, while Austria begins separate peace negotiations. Austerlitz is considered by many to be Napoleons greatest victory. He provoked allies into a battle in a battle of his choosing and on his own terms. He correctly guessed their strategic intent and although their battle plan was not exacly as assumed, the way Napoleon positioned his forces allowed him to quickly react and take advatage of the developing situtation.</p>
