                        <h3>Napoleon Bonaparte</h3>
                        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/288px-Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" alt="Napoleon Bonaparte">
                        <p>Napoleon was born on Corsica into a family of lower nobility of italian descent. His first military posting after graduating in september of 1785 was as a second lieutenant in a artillery regiment. As an artillery officer, he was instrumental in the capture of Fort Toulon in 1793, for which he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In 1795 he successfully suppressed a royalist uprising in the streets of Paris and became a divisional general. In 1799, he orchestrated a coup d'état, overthrowing the Directory and establishing the Consulate. In the aftermath, he emerged as the First Consul, consolidating power and effectively becoming the de facto ruler of France.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that Napoleon was not just briliant military commander, but an adept statesman. Internally, Napoleon implemented the Constitution of the Year VIII, establishing the Consulate as the new form of government. He also initiated the Napoleonic Code, a comprehensive legal system that streamlined and modernized French law. These reforms aimed to provide a stable foundation for the nation, reconciling the revolutionary ideals with the need for order. In 1804, against a backdrop of domestic stability and growing political support, Napoleon took a significant step by declaring himself Emperor of the French.</p>

                        <p>French military commander and one of the most able of Napoleons marshals, Davout was born in the small village of Annoux, province of Champagne, as the eldest son of Jean-François d'Avout (1739-1779), a cavalry officer and his wife (married in 1768) Françoise-Adélaïde Minard de Velars (1741-1810). On the outbreak of the French Revolution, Davout embraced its principles. He was chef de bataillon in a volunteer corps in the campaign of 1792, and distinguished himself at the Battle of Neerwinden the following spring.</p>
                        <p>He served during the Rhine campaign of 1796 and even was a parto of Napoleons egyptian campaign. At the ascension of Napoleon as emperor in 1804, Davout was named as one of the original 18 Marshals of the Empire. Of the marshals, davout was the youngest but throughout his carrer he would demonstrate great skills, especially during the campaign against Prussia in 1806.</p>

                        <h3>Jean de Dieu Soult</h3>
                        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Nicolas_Jean_de_Dieu_Soult.jpg/305px-Nicolas_Jean_de_Dieu_Soult.jpg" alt="Jean de Dieu Soult">
                        <p>Jean-de-Dieu Soult was expected to have a promising career as a lawyer. However, on April 16, 1785, at the age of sixteen, he enlisted as a private in the Royal-Infanterie regiment. At the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789-92), he was a sergeant at Strasbourg. He served under several commanders and was made a general by François-Joseph Lefebvre for his conduct in the Battle of Fleurus (June 1794).</p>
                        <p>Under Napoleon he was put in charge of the southern part of the Kingdom of Naples (1800-02) and in 1804 was made a marshal of France. In the lead up to the battle of Austerlitz, he played a key role in outflanking and encircling Austrian forces at Ulm. Towards the end of the battle of Austerlitz, forces under his command descended from the conquered Pratzen heights and attacked allied forces near Telnitz from the rear, eventually causing them to rout.</p>

                        <h3>Joachim Murat</h3>
                        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Fran%C3%A7ois_Pascal_Simon_G%C3%A9rard_005.jpg/313px-Fran%C3%A7ois_Pascal_Simon_G%C3%A9rard_005.jpg" alt="Joachim Murat">
                        <p>Born into a family of a innkeeper, his parents intended for him to pursue a vocation in the church. Murat had other plans, when he ran away and enlisted in a cavalry regiment in 1787. In October 1795 he was on hand in Paris at the moment that Napoleon Bonaparte was entrusted with the mission of suppressing a royalist insurrection. Murat's contribution in bringing up cannon won him a place as aide-de-camp to Bonaparte for the Italian campaign of 1796/97. During these early campaign, he has garned a reputation as a daring and bit flamboyant cavalry commander. He was among the first newly promoted marshals in 1804.</p>
                        <p>In 1805 he played a conspicuous role in the Austerlitz campaign, helping to pin the Austrian Army in Ulm, where it was forced to surrender, and defeating Austrian and Russian cavalry on the field of Austerlitz.</p>
