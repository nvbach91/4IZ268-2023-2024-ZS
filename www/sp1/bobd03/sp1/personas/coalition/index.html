                        <p>Alexander I was the emperor of Russia from 1801 to 1825. Alexander became Emperor of Russia when his father was assassinated on 23 March 1801. The young emperor was determined to reform the inefficient, highly centralised systems of government that Russia relied upon. Alexander and his close advisers corrected many of the injustices of the preceding reign and made many administrative improvements.</p>
                        <p>Although initialy having more moderate approach to Napoleon, he never the less had to declare war against France due to territorial encroachements. He assumed the role of commander in chief and although he made tactical errors early on, namely not listening to Kutuzov at Austerlitz, in later years of Napolonic wars, he was instrumental figure in leading the alliance to victory.</p>

                        <h3>Francis II of Austria</h3>

                        <p>Francis II was the last Holy Roman Emperor and the first Emperor of Austria. As the head of a vast and multi-ethnic empire, he saw new France as a dangerous threat to existing order and was thus a staunch opponent of the French revolution. He led the nation against France in wars of First and Second coalition.</p>
                        <p>He elevated Austria to the status of an empire (1804) soon after Napoleon had made himself emperor of the French. After Austria took the field against Napoleon for the third time in 1805 and was again defeated, he was forced to sign Treaty of Pressburg. Along with ceding significant territories to France, we eventually had to dissolve the Holy Roman Empire and formally abdicate title of Holy Roman Empire in August 1806.</p>

                        <h3>Mikhail Kutuzov</h3>

                        <p>The son of a lieutenant general who had served in Peter the Great's army, Kutuzov attended the military engineering school at age 12 and entered the Russian army as a corporal when he was only 14. He gained combat experience fighting in Poland (1764-69) and against the Turks (1770-74). He again, now without one eye, fought in the Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1791. When he was called up and given command of joint Russian-Austrian army during the War of Third Coalition.</p>
                        <p>Being a wary and experienced commander, he retreated after hearing of Austrian defeat of Ulm and throughout this kept his army intact in spite of French pursuit. His plan was to retreat back to the Russian frontier to reinforce his army, but was overruled by emperor Alexander. This lead to engaging Napoleon on esentially his terms at Austerlitz, which ended in a disaster for the allied armies.</p>

                        <h3>Pyotr Bagration</h3>
                        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/George_Dawe_-_Portrait_of_General_Pyotr_Bagration_%281765-1812%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/410px-George_Dawe_-_Portrait_of_General_Pyotr_Bagration_%281765-1812%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" alt="Pyotr Bagration">
                        <p>Bagration, a member of the Bagrationi dynasty, was born in Kizlyar. His father served as an officer in the Imperial Russian Army, in which Bagration also enlisted in 1782. During the war of Third Coalition and after defeat of Austrians at Ulm, he was given the task of delaying French advance on Vienna. He won great renown at Hollabrunn, where his force of about 7500 troops held back French forces 5 times the size.</p>
                        <p>During the battle of Austerlitz, Bagration commanded the allied right-wing. Opposing him was the left-wing of French army, commanded by marshal Lannes. When it was clear the battle was lost, he commenced a strategic withdrawal. He later died during battle of Borodino in 1812.</p>
