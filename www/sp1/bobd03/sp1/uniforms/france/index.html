                        <p>Imperial Guard was the small, elite branch of soldiers of the Grande armée. They consisted of senior troops and those who had distinguished themselves during battle. It was under a direct command of Napoleon, who used them carefully and thus they often acted as a tactical reserve and his bodyguars. It consisted of three main echelons: Young guard, Middle guard and Old guard.</p>

                        <p>Most numerous and versatile portion of the imperial army, which served as its backbone. It had the most regiments throughout the war. They mostly fought in lines and marched in formations. The term "Line infantry" may get confusing, because it often incorporates some forms of specialized infatry (ex. Grenadiers). Ordinary non-specialist soldiers were refered to as Fusiliers.</p>

                        <h3>Grenadiers</h3>

                        <p>Originaly, grenadiers were explosive specialists who used hand grenades as offensive weapons during sieges in 17th century. While this practice was no longer used during Napoleonic wars, greadiers still retained the trait of being composed of the strongest and largest soldiers in the army. They were often used to lead assaults such as storming fortifications during sieges.</p>
