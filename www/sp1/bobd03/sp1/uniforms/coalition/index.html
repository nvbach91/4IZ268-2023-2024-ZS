                        <p>Originaly, grenadiers were explosive specialists who used hand grenades as offensive weapons during sieges in 17th century. While this practice was no longer used during Napoleonic wars, greadiers still retained the trait of being composed of the strongest and largest soldiers in the army. They were often used to lead assaults such as storming fortifications during sieges.</p>

                        <p>Most numerous and versatile portion of any army, which served as its backbone. At this time, an austrian line regiment typically consisted of 6 fusilier companies in each of the field batallion - Leib and Oberst. Fusilier here refers to normal musketman, since line regiment normally included specialized units, such as grenadiers. Each regiment had its own zone of recruitment within the multicultural empire.</p>

                        <p>These units were considered something between light and line infantry, however they were mostly used as skirmishers. Before the reforms of 1809, their inability to fight as well in line as standart line infantry regiments was seen as weakness by austrian leadership. However, they regularly performed very well in battle and had great deal of respect from Napoleon.</p>
