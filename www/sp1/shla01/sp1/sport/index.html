            <h5>SPORT FOR EVERYONE</h5>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Stay Hydrated</h2>
                <h4 class="text">Proper hydration is paramount for peak sports performance. Ensure you start hydrating
                    well in advance of your activity, drinking water in the hours leading up to it. During the activity,
                    sip water regularly, adjusting based on intensity and duration. Post-activity, replenish fluids lost
                    through sweat, and pay attention to urine color as an indicator of hydration levels. For more
                    strenuous or prolonged exercises, consider sports drinks to restore electrolyte balance.</h4>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Warm-Up</h2>
                <h4 class="text">A thorough warm-up is a vital precursor to any physical activity. Gradually increasing
                    heart rate and blood flow, it enhances flexibility, mental focus, and muscle activation. This
                    prepares the body for the demands of the upcoming activity, reducing the risk of injuries. Whether
                    through light cardio or dynamic stretching, a well-planned warm-up contributes to optimal physical
                    and mental readiness.</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Cool Down</h2>
                <h4 class="text">Equally important as warming up, a proper cool down facilitates recovery and injury
                    prevention. Gradually decreasing activity intensity allows the body to transition to a relaxed
                    state, while stretching helps improve flexibility and reduce muscle tightness. Incorporating
                    relaxation techniques and continued hydration post-activity supports the body's recovery process.
                </h4>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Proper Gear</h2>
                <h4 class="text">Choosing the right gear is essential for comfort and safety in sports. From appropriate
                    footwear providing support and cushioning to sport-specific protective gear, ensuring equipment is
                    in good condition is crucial. This extends to clothing, where breathable, moisture-wicking materials
                    adapted to the conditions contribute to a more enjoyable and safe sporting experience.</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Technique Matters</h2>
                <h4 class="text">The significance of proper technique extends beyond performance improvement to injury
                    prevention. Efficient movements not only maximize power but also distribute forces evenly across
                    muscles and joints, reducing the risk of overuse injuries. Skill development and consistency are
                    byproducts of focusing on correct technique, and seeking feedback from coaches or instructors can
                    accelerate improvement. Building muscle memory through consistent, proper form contributes to
                    sustained high-level performance over time.</h4>
