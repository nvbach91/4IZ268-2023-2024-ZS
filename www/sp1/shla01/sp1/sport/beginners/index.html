            <h5>TIPS FOR BEGINNERS</h5>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Start Slowly</h2>
                <h4 class="text">For beginners, the key to sustained engagement in sports and physical activities is to
                    start slowly. This approach allows your body to adapt to the new demands gradually. Rushing into
                    intense workouts or pushing beyond your current fitness level may lead to injuries or burnout. Begin
                    with activities that match your current abilities and progressively increase the intensity and
                    duration as your fitness improves. This gradual approach not only minimizes the risk of injury but
                    also helps build a solid foundation for long-term success.</h4>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Consult a Professional</h2>
                <h4 class="text">Seeking guidance from a coach, trainer, or someone experienced in the specific activity
                    you're undertaking can be immensely beneficial. Professionals can provide insights into proper
                    technique, tailor training plans to your individual needs, and offer valuable advice on avoiding
                    common pitfalls. This mentorship ensures that you're on the right track from the beginning,
                    fostering a positive and effective exercise experience.</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Listen to Your Body</h2>
                <h4 class="text">One of the most important aspects of starting any new physical activity is to listen to
                    your body. Pay attention to how it responds to exercise, and differentiate between the normal
                    discomfort associated with physical exertion and pain that could indicate an issue. If you
                    experience persistent or unusual pain, it's crucial to take a break and, if necessary, consult with
                    a healthcare professional to address any underlying concerns.</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Set Realistic Goals</h2>
                <h4 class="text">Setting realistic and achievable goals is essential for beginners. Establish both
                    short-term and long-term objectives to keep yourself motivated. Celebrate small victories along the
                    way, whether it's completing a workout or achieving a specific milestone. Realistic goals create a
                    sense of accomplishment, making the fitness journey more enjoyable and sustainable.</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Learn the Basics</h2>
                <h4 class="text">For those new to a sport or exercise, focusing on learning the basics is paramount.
                    Understanding fundamental skills and techniques lays a solid foundation for future progress. Take
                    the time to familiarize yourself with the correct form and movements, as this knowledge will
                    contribute significantly to your overall success and prevent the development of bad habits.</h4>
