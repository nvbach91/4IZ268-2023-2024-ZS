                <h2>Prioritize Sleep</h2>
                <h4 class="text">Quality sleep is the cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle. Establish a consistent sleep
                    schedule, aiming for 7-9 hours per night. Create a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your body
                    that it's time to wind down. Quality sleep supports physical and mental well-being, enhancing mood,
                    cognitive function, and overall resilience.</h4>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Nourish Your Body</h2>
                <h4 class="text">Adopting a balanced and nutritious diet is essential for vitality. Include a variety of
                    fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats in your meals. Stay hydrated by
                    drinking an adequate amount of water. Pay attention to portion sizes and listen to your body's
                    hunger and fullness cues. A well-nourished body is better equipped to handle daily challenges and
                    maintain optimal health.</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Prioritize Physical Activity</h2>
                <h4 class="text">Regular exercise is a key component of a healthy lifestyle. Find activities you enjoy,
                    whether it's walking, cycling, dancing, or engaging in sports. Aim for at least 150 minutes of
                    moderate-intensity exercise per week. Physical activity not only contributes to weight management
                    but also boosts mood, energy levels, and overall well-being.</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Professional Help When Needed</h2>
                <h4 class="text">It's essential to recognize when the challenges you face exceed your coping abilities.
                    Don't hesitate to consult a mental health professional if you're struggling. Reach out to
                    counselors, therapists, or psychologists who can provide valuable support and guidance tailored to
                    your individual needs.</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Cultivate Mental Well-Being</h2>
                <h4 class="text">Nurture your mental health by incorporating mindfulness practices into your daily
                    routine. Practice meditation, deep breathing exercises, or engage in activities that bring you joy
                    and relaxation. Foster positive relationships with friends and family, and seek support when needed.
                    Taking care of your mental well-being is integral to living a fulfilling and balanced life.</h4>
