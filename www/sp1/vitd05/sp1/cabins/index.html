                    <h2>Forest Edge Cabin</h2>
                    <p>Although oldest of our cabins, it is definitely the most charismatic one.</p>
                    <p>Just few steps from the forest, it is also the furthest one from the center. This adds desired
                        privacy and on top of that, in the winter months, as this is the highest placed of our cabins,
                        you can fairly easily travel on skies right to the nearest slope.</p>

                    <h2>Cliff Side Cabin</h2>
                    <p>The one placed at a small hill, looking like hanging from the cliff observing the valley.</p>
                    <p>The one with the best view, as many tend to call it, this cabin offers you breathtaking view,
                        that gives you the whole Valley on the palm of your hand, with near mountains topping the
                        background.</p>

                    <h2>White Rock Cabin</h2>
                    <p>The comfiest one and ideal for outside parties.</p>
                    <p>This cabin is the closest to the centre, which means you have a commons close. Do not worry about
                        the noise, they are separated enough that if any party was happening, your sleep would not be
                        disturbed.</p>
                    <p>On top of that it also has its own small fireplace with few chairs for you to enjoy a night
                        outside.</p>

                    <h2>Cedar Brook Cabin</h2>
                    <p>Youngest cabin of them all, but also the most modern one.</p>
                    <p>We decided to move the scandinavian architecture to a bit modern extreme and the result is
                        stunning combination of modernity and tradition.</p>
